            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE BOOK OF DANIEL.</head>
            <div type="preface">
               <head>The PREFACE.</head>
               <p>ALthough it be usual with those that write Notes on any part of the Bible, to premise something touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authour of the Book they write on, who he is, and what he is, and what the Scope of the Book of which he is said to be the Authour; yet these things lye so plain and obvious to the eye of every one that reades this Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that it seems altogether needless to give my self or the Reader the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any such Preface.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49984:4"/>
               <p>For the Book it self declares again and again who is the Writer of it in the five last Chapters, which are merely Prophetical, and no History of the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> and of the Jews interwoven into them, as there is in the seven first, or rather the first six of those seven. Nor is it any sign that the same <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> writ not both, because the latter six of the first, from Verse <hi>4.</hi> of Chap. <hi>2.</hi> to the end of Chap. <hi>7.</hi> are writ in Chaldee, the other in Hebrew, and that he speaks of himself in the third person in the seven former, but in the first in the five latter. For the first six of the seven being mainly Historical, and the Dream of the Statue being <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s dream, not <hi>Daniel</hi>'s (which writ in Chaldee, is the reason why the Vision of the four Beasts, Chap. <hi>7.</hi> is writ in Chaldee also, it so perfectly answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of the Statue) and so all things respecting what the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> did, or befell them, as much, or rather more, than the Jews, it was fit that short Chronicle should be writ in the language of the Countrey and People, who were so plainly concerned, and who knew the truth of the things. So that it is a kind of appeal to them therein. And
<pb facs="tcp:49984:4"/>it being Historical, it was fit <hi>Daniel</hi> should speak of himself, who makes so great a part of the Story, in the third person, it being also more modest and becoming. And the things being so weighty, and himself an eye-witness of them, in a manner, all along, it is incredible <hi>Daniel</hi> should omit the recording of them. So that this <hi>Daniel</hi> that is so often mentioned in this Book, is certainly the Writer thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> of the first Chapter, and the three first Verses of the second in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the things of the first Chapter being not so notorious as what follows; and in <hi>Chaldee,</hi> from the fourth Verse of the second, to the end of the seventh Chapter, occasion being given to begin there, from the Answer of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in Syriack or Chaldee, and for the reasons abovesaid; And of the last five in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> his native language, those Prophecies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the People of the Jews and the Church of God at large, even to the consummation of all things: But they were to himself for the present but private Memoirs of the Visions the God of <hi>Israel</hi> had imparted to him, but so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as were to be kept carefully by the Jewish Church to all Posterity.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49984:5"/>
               <p>As for that other Query, what this <hi>Daniel</hi> was; it is likewise plain from the Book it self, that he was a singularly wise and holy Man, and a Jew of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and of the Bloud-royal, and a Prince even in the Court of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that he lived in that garb, and not in the austere habit and garb of a Prophet, which therefore makes the Jews de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that he was one, as if not <hi>Wisedom,</hi> but the <hi>Beard</hi> made the Philosopher. But the Visions seen and recorded by him demonstrate him to be a Prophet indeed, and our Saviour himself does him the right to call him so, <hi>Mat. 24.15.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly, <hi>Daniel</hi>'s scope in writing this Book, or at least of the Spirit of God that put him upon it, is most evident. That it might be a lasting Record of the faithfulness and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveness of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> in behalf of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed people the Jews, and an evident argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his far extending Providence over his Church, which according to the right sense of the Visions revealed to <hi>Daniel</hi> reaches continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly from his times to the end of the World.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>ARG. Jehoiakim <hi>is taken captive by</hi> Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael <hi>and</hi> Azariah <hi>are committed to the care of</hi> Aspenaz, <hi>Master of his Eunuchs, for three years, who gives new Names to them. They refusing the King's portion, grow fair and well liking with pulse and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. At the three years end they are found by the King in all matters of Wisedom, ten times better than all the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Astrologers in his Realm.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim King of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar King of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim King of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar, to the house of his God, and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And the King spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his Eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the Kings seed, and of the Princes:</p>
               <p n="4">4 Children in whom was no blemish, but well fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and skilfull in all wisedom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the Kings palace, and whom they might teach the learning, and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And the King appointed them a daily provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Kings meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49984:6"/>end thereof they might stand before the King.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Now among these were of the children of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah:</p>
               <p n="7">7 Unto whom the prince of the Eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar, and to Hananiah of Shadrach, and to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shael of Meshach, and to Azariah of Abednego.</p>
               <p n="8">8 But Daniel purposed in his heart, that he would not defile himself with the portion of the kings meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested of the prince of the Eunuchs, that he might not defile himself.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the Prince of the Eunuchs.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And the Prince of the Eunuchs said unto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, I fear my Lord the King, who hath appointed your meat and your drink, for why should he see your faces worse liking, than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the King.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the Prince of the Eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shael and Azariah,</p>
               <p n="12">12 Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days, and let them give pulse to eat, and water to drink.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Then let our countenances be looked upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the Kings meat: and as thou feest, deal with thy servants.</p>
               <p n="14">14 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And at the end of ten days, their countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces appeared fairer, and fatter in flesh, than all the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49984:6"/>children which did eat the portion of the Kings meat.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.</p>
               <p n="17">17 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge, and skill in all learning and wisedom, and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Now at the end of the days that the King had said, he should bring them in, then the Prince of the Eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar.</p>
               <p n="19">19 And the King communed with them: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them all was found none like Daniel, Hana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah, Mishael and Azariah: therefore stood they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And in all matters of wisedom and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the King enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the Magicians, and Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that were in all his realm.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And Daniel continued even unto the first year of King Cyrus.</p>

               <p>AND in the second year of the reign of Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Then the King commanded to call the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the Astrologers, and the Sorcerers, and the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49984:8"/>Chaldeans, for to shew the King his dreams: so they came and stood before the King.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And the King said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Then spake the Chaldeans to the King in Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, O King, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The King answered, and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me; if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</p>
               <p n="6">6 But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts, and rewards, and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</p>
               <p n="7">7 They answered again, and said, Let the King tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it.</p>
               <p n="8">8 The King answered, and said, I know of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</p>
               <p n="9">9 But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>
               <p n="10">10 The Chaldeans answered before the King, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the Kings matter: therefore there is no King, Lord, nor Ruler, that asked such things at any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, or Astrologer, or Chaldean.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49984:9"/>
               <p n="11">11 And it is a rare thing that the King requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the King, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</p>
               <p n="12">12 For this cause the King was angry, and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</p>
               <p n="13">13 And the decree went forth, that the wise men should be slain, and they sought Daniel and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to be flain.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to Arioch the Captain of the Kings guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.</p>
               <p n="15">15 He answered, and said to Arioch, the Kings Captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the King? Then Arioch made the thing known unto Daniel.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Then Daniel went in and desired of the King that he would give him time, and that he would shew the King the interpretation.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah his companions:</p>
               <p n="18">18 That they would desire mereies of the God of heaven concerning this secret, that Daniel and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision: then Daniel blessed the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the Name of God for ever and ever: for wisedom and might are his:</p>
               <p n="21">21 And he changeth the times and the seasons:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49984:9"/>he removeth Kings, and setteth up Kings, he giveth wisedom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding.</p>
               <p n="22">22 He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with him.</p>
               <p n="23">23 I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisedom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the Kings matter.</p>
               <p n="24">24 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the King had ordained to destroy the wise men of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon: he went and said thus unto him, Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the King, and I will shew unto the King the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the King in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the King the interpretation.</p>
               <p n="26">26 The King answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thereof?</p>
               <p n="27">27 Daniel answered in the presence of the King, and said the secret which the King hath demanded, cannot the wise men, the Astrologians, the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Soothsayers shew unto the King:</p>
               <p n="28">28 But there is a God in heaven that revealeth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and maketh known to the King Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49984:10"/>
               <p n="29">29 As for thee, O King, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets, maketh known to thee, what shall come to pass.</p>
               <p n="30">30 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisedom that I have more than any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the King, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</p>
               <p n="31">31 Thou, O King sawest, and behold, a great image: this great image, whose brightness was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, stood before thee, and the form thereof was terrible.</p>
               <p n="32">32 This images head was of fine gold, his breast and his armes of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass.</p>
               <p n="33">33 His legs of iron, his feet part of iron, and part of clay.</p>
               <p n="34">34 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron, and clay, and brake them to pieces.</p>
               <p n="35">35 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like the chaff of the summer threshing floors, and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</p>
               <p n="36">36 This is the dream, and we will tell the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thereof before the King.</p>
               <p n="37">37 Thou, O King, art a King of Kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49984:10"/>
               <p n="38">38 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field, and the souls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all: thou art this head of gold.</p>
               <p n="39">39 And after thee shall arise another kingdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</p>
               <p n="40">40 And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces; and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</p>
               <p n="41">41 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters clay, and part of iron: the kingdom shall be divided, but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixt with miry clay.</p>
               <p n="42">42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay; so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</p>
               <p n="43">43 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixt with clay.</p>
               <p n="44">44 And in the days of these Kings, shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</p>
               <p n="45">45 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the gold: the great God hath made known to the King what shall come to pass hereafter, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49984:11"/>the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</p>
               <p n="46">46 Then the King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation, and sweet odours unto him.</p>
               <p n="47">47 The King answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of Gods, and a Lord of Kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</p>
               <p n="48">48 Then the King made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole Province of Babylon, and chief of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours over all the wise men of Babylon.</p>
               <p n="49">49 Then Daniel requested of the King, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the assairs of the Province of Babylon: but Daniel sate in the gate of the King.</p>

Where the Head naturally takes the first place, and as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally the rest succeed in order. And it is plain here, that the Head is the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire.

Both places signifie the utter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolishing all the Idolatrous tyranny remaining in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire at that time, whether in the <hi>Secular</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Powers.

The true Apostolick Church purged from all Superstitious, Idolatrous and Tyrannical
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49984:14"/>Principles and Practices will overspread the whole world in a manner.

For <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the first head of the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Monarchy reigned not passing six or seven years (or but two or three according to some) in that enlarged Empire, whenas <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in his <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> Empire reigned 43 years, for far the greatest part, most splendidly and prosperously, insomuch that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of his prosperity cast him into that Septennial deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy, out of which he was recovered, and gave praise to the God of Heaven. So that he had 36 years of clear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity in his Empire of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as he reigned but a small time in the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Empire, so he was vanquished ingloriously by the hand of a woman <hi>Tomyris</hi> a <hi>Scythian</hi> Queen, who cut off his head and cast it into a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of bloud, saying, <hi>Satia te</hi> Cyre <hi>sanguine quem sitisti. And another third kingdom of Brass.</hi> This shews plainly that the golden, silver and brass part of the Image signifie three distinct Kingdoms, and no more. But now it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in History, that as the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Empire succeeded the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> so the <hi>Macedonick</hi> or <hi>Grecian</hi> succeeded the <hi>Medo-Persian.</hi> For <hi>Alexander Macedo,</hi> after he had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished <hi>Darius Codomannus</hi> in his last battel at <hi>Arbela,</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Monarchy from the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> to the <hi>Grecks,</hi> about the third year of the hundred and twelfth Olympiad. <hi>Which shall bear rule over all the earth,</hi> 1 Maccab. 1.

Which is the time that the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast rises out of the earth. And why not out of a white <hi>clayie clammy</hi> earth, such as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49984:16"/>Potters make use of, as well as out of any other earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides? Nor will any man, I think, while he considers that the <hi>Iron</hi> here signifies <hi>Men,</hi> a body Politick of them, stick to admit that this <hi>Clay</hi> does signifie so likewise. But there being so palpable a difference betwixt <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Clay,</hi> it is manifest there must be as great a difference betwixt those two bodies Politick, and therefore the <hi>Iron</hi> must be the <hi>Secular,</hi> the <hi>Clay</hi> the <hi>Ecclesiastick.</hi> As it is said of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Hierarchy, which is the little Horn, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.24. that that Horn or King shall be <hi>divers</hi> from the rest. Which diversification here betwixt the <hi>Secular</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> power signify'd by the <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Clay,</hi> need not be expressed in words, the Symbols themselves being so apparently different. <hi>Part of Potters Clay and part of Iron.</hi> This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that by that time the Empire was divided into ten Kingdoms, the <hi>Summa potestas</hi> began to be neither in the <hi>Secular</hi> power absolutely, nor in the <hi>Hierarchical,</hi> but they were so mingled together, that it was not complete or full, nor sure without the concurrence of both, the Ecclesiastick power getting such an hank upon the Secular <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia,</hi> the effects whereof within no long time appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a witness. <hi>The kingdom shall be divided,</hi> that is, The power will be divided or shared betwixt the Papal or Sacerdotal Hierarchy, and the Secular orders of Emperours and Kings. For the <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Clay</hi> cannot stand for the division of the Empire into ten Kingdoms; for that the ten Toes prefigure, but the sharing of the <hi>Summa potestas</hi> betwixt the <hi>Secular</hi> Magistrate and the <hi>Papal</hi> or <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Hierarchy, the Empire, by their encroachments and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal power over all the ten Kings, the Emperours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves not excepted, becoming a <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Empire rather than <hi>Secular.</hi> To which Papal or Sacerdotal Empire those words seem to refer. <hi>But there shall be in it of the strength of Iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the Iron mixed with the miry clay,</hi> that is, The Sword-men or Secular power of the ten Kings was so assured to the maintaining of the Power and the Institutes of the Papal Hierarchy (though never so foul or idolatrous so they made for the Sacerdotal worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest)
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49984:16"/>that the Papal Empire, or the Empire framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that pattern and scope, was as it were strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Iron. Which is that which is intimated, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.13. where the ten Kings are said to give their strength and power to the Beast that was, and is not, and yet is. Which is the Empire re-fashioned again into a Pagan-like Idolatrous form for the worldly advantage of the Papal Hierarchy. Thus was the <hi>Iron</hi> mixed with the mirie <hi>Clay,</hi> the ten Kings cleaving so close to the Interest of the Papal Idolatrous Clergy.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>ARG. Nebuchadnezzar <hi>dedicateth a golden Image in the Plain of</hi> Dura, <hi>in the Province of</hi> Babylon. Shadrach, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shach <hi>and</hi> Abednego <hi>decline the worshipping of it, and are accused thereof to the King. He grievously threatning them, they yet stoutly persist in their pious resolution against so gross Idolatry. They are cast into a fiery furnace, but the God of</hi> Israel <hi>miraculously delivers them.</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at the Miracles, blesseth their God, and promotes them in the Province of</hi> Babylon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NEbuchadnezzar the King made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the Province of Babylon.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the King sent to gather together the Princes, the Governours, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the Judges, the Treasurers, the Counsellers, the Sheriffs, and all the Rulers of the Provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar the King had set up.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Then the Princes, the Governours, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the Judges, the Treasures, the Counsellers, the Sheriffs, and all the Rulers of the Provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the King had set up, and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Then an Herald cried aloud, To you it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, O people, nations and languages,</p>
               <p n="5">5 That at what time ye hear the sound of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49984:19"/>Flute, Harp, Sackbut, Psaltery, Dulcimer, and all kinds of Musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the King hath set up:</p>
               <p n="6">6 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fiery furnace.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the Cornet, Flute, Harp, Sackbut, Psaltery, and all kinds of Musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the King had set up.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</p>
               <p n="9">9 They spake, and said to the King Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, O King, live for ever.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Thou, O King, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the Corner, Flute, Harp, Sackbut, Psaltery and Dulcimer, and all kinds of Musick, shall sall down and worship the golden image:</p>
               <p n="11">11 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning siery surnace.</p>
               <p n="12">12 There are certain Jews, whom thou hast set over the affairs of the Province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego: these men, O King, have not regarded thee, they serve not thy gods, nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the golden image which thou hast set up.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury, commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach and Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego: then they brought these men before the King.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49984:19"/>
               <p n="14">14 Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego? do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</p>
               <p n="15">15 Now if ye be ready, that at what time ye hear the sound of the Cornet, Flute, Harp, Sackbut, Psaltery and Dulcimer, and all kinds of Musick, ye fall down, and worship the image which I have made, well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a siery furnace: and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</p>
               <p n="16">16 Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego answered, and said to the King: O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not carefull to answer thee in this matter.</p>
               <p n="17">17 If it be so, our God whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O King.</p>
               <p n="18">18 But if not, be it known unto thee, O King, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship thy golden image which thou hast set up.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego: therefore he spake, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more, than it was wont to be heat.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army, to bind Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49984:20"/>
               <p n="22">22 Therefore because the Kings commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the slame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, sell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p>
               <p n="24">24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the King was astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his Counsellers, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered, and said unto the King: True, O King.</p>
               <p n="25">25 He answered, and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="26">26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery surnace, and spake, and said, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drach, Meshach and Abednego, ye servants of the most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</p>
               <p n="27">27 And the Princes, Governours and Captains, and the Kings Counsellers, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who hath sent his Angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the Kings word, and yielded their bodies, that they might
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49984:20"/>not serve, nor worship any God, except their own God.</p>
               <p n="29">29 Therefore I make a Decree, That every peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nation and language, which speak any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</p>
               <p n="30">30 Then the King promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, in the Province of Babylon.</p>

A medley of such considerations as these might carry him on to the erecting this Image, the thing suiting so well with his pride and ambition, while the great aim of them that counselled him to it, was to ensnare <hi>Shadrach, Meshach</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> out of the envy they bore them, for the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able employments they had in the Kingdom, being no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives thereof.</p>

This seems to have put <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this rage and fury, even to the misfiguring his own vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage by the distemper of his passion, he being impatient to meet with any power that could baffle his. But there is a greatness in the true Saints of God that no Grandeur can match, of which St. <hi>John</hi> witnesses, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 4.4. Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. By virtue whereof they were enabled to overcome both the World and Antichrist at once.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 25. <hi>I see four men loose.</hi> For they were cast in bound, haply with some small Chains of Iron, for Cords the fire would instantly consume. <hi>The form of the fourth like the Son of God.</hi> This is he (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5.) who being in the form of God, was in the fulness of time found in fashion as a man, and humbled himself even to the death of the Cross, to redeem the world from sin and misery. This, in a word, was Christ, according to the opinion of the Ancients, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Irenaeus, Hippolytus Martyr, Augustinus</hi> and others. And all those Fathers or other Interpreters that make Christ the conducter of the children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of the land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and a frequent visiter of the ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs will easily agree to this opinion, and he being the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> it is reasonable to conceive he neglected not his people in their captivity, and the least in their greatest straits. And him whom the Winds and Seas obeyed in his incarnation, here the element of fire obeys in his prelusion thereto in this, appearing visibly in humane shape to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour his servants.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 27. <hi>Nor was an hair of their head singed.</hi> This is an unexpressible great miracle, that a furnace seven times hotter than usual for dispatching Delinquents, that the fierceness of the fire thereof should be so tamed, or every thing that belonged to those innocent persons so strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and held together against the fury of so raging an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49984:23"/>that not so much as an hair of their head was singed, nor any scent of fire on their garments. This demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates the Divinity of the fourth person that walked with them. Nothing less than the Son of God could effect this.</p>

                  <p>ARG. Nebuchadnezzar <hi>moved by several miraculous things done through the assistence of the God of</hi> Israel, <hi>and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by</hi> Daniel <hi>his interpreting the dream mentioned here that so nearly concerned him when his Magicians could not, the sad event also ratifying the interpretation, he humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses the power and dominion of the most High, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the same before all Nations and People.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>NEbuchadnezzar the King, unto all people, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and languages that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.</p>
               <p n="3">3 How great are his signs? and how mighty are his wonders? his kingdom is an everlasting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his dominion is from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p n="4">4 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:</p>
               <p n="5">5 I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed, and the visions of my head troubled me.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Then came in the Magicians, the Astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the Southsayers; and I told the dream before them, but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:49984:24"/>
               <p n="8">8 But at the last Daniel came in before me, (whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the Name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods) and before him I told the dream, saying,</p>
               <p n="9">9 O Belteshazzar, Master of the Magicians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.</p>
               <p n="11">11 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.</p>
               <p n="12">12 The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.</p>
               <p n="13">13 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher, and an Holy One came down from heaven.</p>
               <p n="14">14 He cryed aloud, and said thus; Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit; let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Nevertheless, leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Let his heart be changed from mans, and let
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49984:24"/>a beasts heart be given unto him, and let seven times pass over him.</p>
               <p n="17">17 This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy Ones: to the intent that the living may know, that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</p>
               <p n="18">18 This dream, I King Nebuchadnezzar have seen: Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are not able to make known unto me the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation: but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Then Daniel (whose name was Belteshazzar) was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him: The King spake and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation thereof trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered, and said, My Lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.</p>
               <p n="20">20 The tree that thou sawest which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth:</p>
               <p n="21">21 Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:</p>
               <p n="22">22 It is thou, O King, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And whereas the King saw a watcher, and an
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49984:25"/>holy One coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times pass over him:</p>
               <p n="24">24 This is the interpretation, O King, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my Lord the King:</p>
               <p n="25">25 That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as Oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he will.</p>
               <p n="26">26 And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</p>
               <p n="27">27 Wherefore, O King, let my counsel be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p n="28">28 All this came upon the King Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
               <p n="29">29 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</p>
               <p n="30">30 The King spake and said, Is not this great Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, that I have built for the house of the Kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49984:25"/>
               <p n="31">31 While the word was in the Kings mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O King Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thee.</p>
               <p n="32">32 And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as Oxen, and seven times shall, pass over thee, untill thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</p>
               <p n="33">33 The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar, and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as Oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles feathers, and his nails like birds claws.</p>
               <p n="34">34 And at the end of the days, I Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar lift up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised, and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his kingdom is from generation to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="35">35 And all the inhabitants of the earth are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as nothing: and he doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What dost thou?</p>
               <p n="36">36 At the same time my reason returned unto me: and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me, and my Counsellers, and my Lords sought unto me, and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49984:26"/>
               <p n="37">37 Now I Nebuchadnezzar, praise, and extoll, and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment, and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</p>

But upon <hi>Shadrach, Meshach</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> their being so mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously delivered out of it, he then magnifies their piety for disobeying his command, and extolls the God of <hi>Israel</hi> above all gods.

But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a twelve month he lets the reins loose to that natural vice of his, and brings the predicted evil upon himself, which he was forewarned of. In which, when he had smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a time, and was restored, he lift up his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and blesseth the most High that liveth for ever and ever, and is such a penitent that he makes confession of the humbling hand of God upon him to all the world, as we may observe in perusing the Chapter through.</p>

Latin.</hi> The sad forlorn condition of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> struck with a ferine melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, that made him utterly unsit for all business, is set out by a double Symbol, the one of a tree cut down to the stump and root, which sets out his being deprived of all his faculties that branched out from his soul, in virtue whereof he was able to actuate and govern the whole body politick of so vast an Empire. And the same is set out by another Symbol of a man metamorphozed into a Brute, which plainly incapacitates him for the ruling over men. This latter Symbol is pursued in the rest of this Verse.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49984:27"/>the year say others, counting by Winters and Summers, which will amount to three years and an half, others se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>months,</hi> the Moon being especially related to Maniacal people, and other some seven weeks. And certainly time signifies any of these. Whence appears the great requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siteness that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s time, and times, and half a time should be explained, in the Apocalypse, by 42 months or 1260 days. See <hi>Arithmetica Apocalyptica,</hi> Query 2.</p>

The voice of the Angel is continued from the beginning of the 14th verse till this, and here it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him that this whole business is determined by the <hi>sentence</hi> of the holy Angels, which is called a <hi>Decree</hi> and <hi>Demand.</hi> A <hi>Demand</hi> in such a sense as <hi>Rogare legem</hi> imports, and <hi>Rogatio,</hi> which signifies also an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> but with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>Rogation</hi> or <hi>Deliberation</hi> about it; but is called a <hi>Decree</hi> in respect to the <hi>determination</hi> thereof. See <hi>Castellio</hi> on the place. The rest of the verse shews the end of this decree, which is also declared by the Angel to <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> in this Vision.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49984:28"/>the hand of the most High, who let men swell never so much in conceit of their own power and atchievements, his eye is still upon them, and his over-ruling hand commands all.</p>

Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee.

But surely the English translation is the better sense. For there is no answering when nothing is spoke to answer to.

And <hi>Bellerophon</hi> in particular, though in the exalted Paroxysms of his complexion he might seem to ride on his winged <hi>Pegasus</hi> amongst the Clouds, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is resembled to a winged Lion for the aspiring loftiness of his spirit, yet he is famous for his affecting of Solitude, and wandring alone in the fields of <hi>Lycia</hi> in his melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dumps, whence he gave the name to them of <hi>Campus Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus,</hi> which is something like the solitary living of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> by reason of the <hi>Boanthropy</hi> he was smitten with,

Thou shalt be driven from men by the overpowering distemper of thine own melancholy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The sudden affrightfull sounding of that voice in his ears, in the preceding verse, could not but have a mighty impression upon him, even to the putting him out of his wits, his natural complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on making him so obnoxious thereto, which seems to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in the beginning of the next verse.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>ARG. Belshazzar<hi>'s impious feast, in which the Vessels of the Temple of the God of</hi> Israel <hi>are prophaned. He is terrified by seeing an hand writing upon the Wall what none of his Magicians could reade and interpret.</hi> Daniel <hi>interprets the hand-writing, and reproves the King for his Pride and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BElshazzar the King made a great feast to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of his Lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bring the golden and silver vessels, which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the Temple which was in Jerusalem, that the King and his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, his Wives and his Concubines might drink there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the Temple of the house of God, which was at Jerusalem; and the King and his Princes, his Wives and his Concubines drank in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 They drunk wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood and of stone.</p>
               <p n="5">5 In the same hour came forth fingers of a mans hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the Kings Palace; and the King saw the part of the hand that wrote.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Then the Kings countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:49984:30"/>
               <p n="7">7 The King cried aloud to bring in the Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the Chaldeans, and the Soothsayers: and the King spake and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall reade this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be cloathed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Then came in all the Kings wise men, but they could not reade the writing, nor make known to the King the interpretation thereof.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Then was King Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his Lords were astonied.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Now the Queen, by reason of the words of the King and his Lords, came into the banquet-house; and the Queen spake and said, O King, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance be changed.</p>
               <p n="11">11 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods, and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisedom like the wisedom of the gods, was found in him; whom the King Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the King, I say, thy father made master of the Magicians, Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Chaldeans and Soothsayers;</p>
               <p n="12">12 Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts were found in the same Daniel, whom the King na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Then was Daniel brought in before the King; and the King spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49984:30"/>that Daniel, which art of the children of the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Judah, whom the King my father brought out of Jewry?</p>
               <p n="14">14 I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light, and understanding, and excellent wisedom is found in thee.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And now the wise men, the Astrologers have been brought in before me, that they should reade this writing, and make known unto me the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof: but they could not shew the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the thing.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst reade the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be cloathed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Then Daniel answered and said before the King, Let thy gifts be to thy self, and give thy rewards to another, yet I will reade the writing unto the King, and make known to him the interpretation.</p>
               <p n="18">18 O thou King, the most high God gave Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour.</p>
               <p n="19">19 And for the majesty that he gave him, all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nations and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive, and whom he would he set up, and whom he would he put down.</p>
               <p n="20">20 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:49984:31"/>
               <p n="21">21 And he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like Oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.</p>
               <p n="22">22 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thine heart, though thou knewest all this:</p>
               <p n="23">23 But hast lifted up thy self against the Lord of heaven, and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines have drunk wine in them, and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p n="24">24 Then was the part of the hand sent from him, and this writing was written.</p>
               <p n="25">25 And this is the writing that was written, MENE MENE, TEKEL UPHARSIN.</p>
               <p n="26">26 This is the interpretation of the thing, MENE, God hath numbred thy kingdom, and finished it.</p>

Whereupon the King's countenance changed with affright and horrour, and an agony of mind seized upon him, so that it loosned the ligaments of his loins (<hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages renum,</hi> as the Latine has it) so that for very fear his Urine came from him, as <hi>Grotius</hi> Comments upon the place, and wet his knees, as elsewhere it is expressed in the Prophets, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.17. and <hi>chap.</hi> 21.7. nay made both knees knock one against another from the violence of his trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and fear.

And lastly, others that <hi>God dazled</hi> their sight, and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their perception. But it's more easie to conceive, that it being a night of such revelling and feasting, that the wise men grown tipsie with drinking, and drunk with conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of mind, as sympathizing with their great Master,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49984:32"/>and the writing being writ more scribledly on purpose by the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> whom the Jews make the Pen-man, that they were at a loss in reading it. And yet there is still a more plain solution of this difficulty than this by rendring [<gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>] as was noted above [that is to say]. And then the sentence runs thus.

As for the first part, MENE, MENE, <hi>He has numbred, He has numbred;</hi> this by reading <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> chap. 25.12. chap. 27.7. and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49984:34"/>chap. 29.10. where is expresly set down the duration of the Kingdom of <hi>Babylon,</hi> viz. <hi>seventy years,</hi> and <hi>till Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar's Sons son,</hi> which time was then near expiring, he might I say well interpret [He has numbred, he has num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred] of the certain finishing of the number of the duration of the Kingdom of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to whose King the hand-writing is directed, and declare as in the next verse.</p>

But now for the interpretation of TEKEL. <hi>He was weighed,</hi> it is not improbable but that in the reading of TEKEL there might be a Paronomastical resonancy of words in his mind that would make the whole sense thus, TEKEL VEATTE KAL. He was weighed and thou art light; which <hi>Daniel</hi> expresses thus more fully to the King, <hi>Thou art weighed in the balance and art found wanting;</hi> that is, found to want weight, and therefore rejected as money illegitimate.</p>

And the Prophetick Analysis of the last, UPHARSIN <hi>[and the Persians</hi> is manifestly Parono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastical, where he takes PERES by it self, which signifies a <hi>Persian,</hi> and in a Paronomastical allusion to the word <hi>[Paras]</hi> which signifies to divide, he makes out this full sense of UPHARSIN. <hi>Thy kingdom is divided and rent from thee, and given to the Medes and Persians.</hi> See Dr. <hi>H.

Kings of old, as <hi>Munster</hi> observes, were strict keepers of their word, and the veracity of <hi>Daniel</hi> being known, it had been the more inglorious here for him to have receded from it, as if he had sent for him to tell him, not what was true, but pleasing, and it may be he was so much humbled as to seek to ingratiate himself with so holy a man, who might intercede with God for him: These things might be. But it was most likely of all that so sad an interpretation might so inrage him and his Princes, that they would tear <hi>Daniel</hi> in pieces as a Traytor, and one that kept intelligence with <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the <hi>Persians</hi> that besieged the Town, and therefore it was an inspired fortitude in

                     <hi>Daniel,</hi> that he dared to make known to the King the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the writing.

               <argument>
                  <p>ARG. Daniel <hi>is made chief of the three Presidents, which</hi> Darius <hi>set over his Kingdom. The other two Presidents, together with the Princes moved with envy, procure of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius <hi>an idolatrous decree to entrap</hi> Daniel. Daniel <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the breach of this decree, is cast into the Den of Lions. The God of</hi> Israel <hi>sends his Angel to shut the mouths of the Lions and saveth</hi> Daniel. <hi>The Lions that spared</hi> Daniel, <hi>streightway devour his Accusers, being thrown into their Den.</hi> Darius <hi>thereupon makes Proclamation through all his Dominions, that all Men fear and tremble before the God of</hi> Daniel.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty Princes, which should be over the whole kingdom.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And over these, three Presidents, (of whom Daniel was first) that the Princes might give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts unto them, and the King should have no damage.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Then this Daniel was preferred above the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents, and Princes, because an excellent spirit was in him, and the King thought to set him over the whole realm.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Then the Presidents and Princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom: but they could find none occasion or fault: forasmuch as he was faithfull, neither was there any errour or fault found in him.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Then said these men, We shall not find any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:49984:35"/>
               <p n="6">6 Then these Presidents and Princes assembled together to the King, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.</p>
               <p n="7">7 All the Presidents of the Kingdom, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and the Princes, the Counsellours and the Captains have consulted together to establish a royal Statute, and to make a firm Decree, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O King, he shall be cast into the den of Lions.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Now, O King, establish the Decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the Law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Wherefore King Darius signed the writing, and the Decree.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house, and his windows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying, and making supplication before his God.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Then they came near, and spake before the King concerning the Kings Decree, Hast thou not signed a Decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man, within thirty days, save of thee, O King, shall be cast into the den of Lions? the King answered, and said, The thing is true, according to the Law of the Medes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians which altereth not.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Then answered they, and said before the King,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49984:36"/>That Daniel which is of the captivity of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Judah, regardeth not thee, O King, nor the Decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion three times a day.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Then the King when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the Sun, to deliver him.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Then these men assembled unto the King, and said unto the King, Know, O King, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that no Decree nor Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute which the King establisheth, may be changed.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Then the King commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of Lions: now the King spake, and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</p>
               <p n="17">17 And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den, and the King sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords, that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Then the King went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick brought before him, and his sleep went from him.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Then the King arose very early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and went in haste unto the den of Lions.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And when he came to the den, he cryed with a lamentable voyce unto Daniel, and the King spake, and said to Daniel; O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the Lions?</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:49984:36"/>
               <p n="21">21 Then said Daniel unto the King, O King, live for ever.</p>
               <p n="22">22 My God hath sent his Angel, and hath shut the Lions mouths, that they have not hurt me: for as much as before him innocency was found in me: and also before thee, O King, have I done no hurt.</p>
               <p n="23">23 Then was the King exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den: so Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</p>
               <p n="24">24 And the King commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of Lions, them, their children, and their wives: and the Lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Then King Darius wrote unto all people, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and languages that dwell in all the earth, Peace be multiplied unto you.</p>
               <p n="26">26 I make a Decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom, men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.</p>
               <p n="27">27 He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven, and in earth: who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the Lions.</p>
               <p n="28">28 So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>Three Presidents.</hi> Three <hi>Sarkin,</hi> which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews expound by <hi>Soterim,</hi> Exactours, as exacting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring an account of those hundred and twenty Princes of the Provinces, of what was expended and received, that the King should have no damage, or as the <hi>seventy</hi> render it, That the King might be eased of that trouble. See <hi>Munster</hi> on the place. And it seems <hi>Darius</hi> made <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> the chief of those three Presidents for his singular Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Faithfulness and Honesty, besides his skill and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in Interpreting the Hand-writing on the Wall, that predicted the ruin of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> which was the bringing in of <hi>Darius.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>Thought to set him over the whole Realm.</hi> And <hi>Daniel</hi> being one whom for his ability and integrity he could so fully confide in, and himself being old and affecting his ease, though sufficiently relishing the Title and Honour of an Emperour or Monarch, was inclineable to make <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> his sole chief Minister of State, and as it were Vice-Roy over his whole Kingdom, eying onely one side of the business, and not considering how much it would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please the other Presidents and Princes, that not a <hi>Native</hi> but a <hi>Captive</hi> should under him be made the sole Ruler over his whole Empire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>Sought to find occasion.</hi> Here those two peculiar Poisons in the Courts of Potentates, <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> began violently to ferment in the breasts of the Presidents
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49984:37"/>and Princes, insomuch as, right or wrong, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to pretend some Crime against <hi>Daniel,</hi> to make him forfeit the King's favour and lose his Life. But his unblemished integrity in the administration of the King's Affairs, and in all Moral Conversation was such, that they could lay no hold on him there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>Except we find it against him concerning the Law of his God.</hi> Not that they were not persuaded, that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s worship of the God of his Fathers were as good if not a better and truer Religion than the worship of <hi>Bel,</hi> or any of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> gods, it being demonstrated by <hi>Daniel</hi> so repeatedly, by his true expositions of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s dreams, and by his God's delivering the three Jews out of the fiery Furnace, and very lately by <hi>Daniel</hi>'s inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the Hand-writing on the Wall, which things they could not be ignorant of, but they being mere Politicians, nor so sensible of any Religion as their own interest, and their hearts being envenomed with Pride and Envy, they would, though against their own Conscience, lay a snare for <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the pious and conscientious exercise of his Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>All the Presidents,</hi> &amp;c. This joynt consenting together of all the Grandees of his Kingdom, who might plausibly seem to understand better what was for the King's interest and the aggrandizing of him with his people, than his own single self, and the conclusion being not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull to so mighty a Potentate, who several of them have affected divine honours while they were yet alive, as <hi>Domitian</hi> and others; these things all considered the plot is not unskilfully laid. Nor if we consider the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicts of the mystical King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Divine Service and praying either to God, Saint or Angel for some years together, till addresses have been made to himself for Reconciliation from the party he was offended with, can this decree against the asking any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of God or Man for thirty days or one single month, saving to <hi>Darius</hi> the King, when the Interdict here in England in King <hi>John</hi>'s time by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> lasted near
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49984:38"/>seventy months, seem otherwise than not onely credible, but even tolerable, in these heathen Politicians, when his Holiness himself makes so bold with Religion, in Kingdoms where the true God is known, for his own interest. See <hi>Fowlis</hi> his <hi>History of Popish Treasons and Ʋsurpations,</hi> lib. 5. cap. 2.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>Law of the Medes and Persians which altereth not.</hi> See the Book of <hi>Esther,</hi> cap. 1. v. 19. There were certain laws amongst the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> which were called <hi>Immutable,</hi> as those laws amongst the Romans called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,</hi> which being past under a certain form, the King himself could not revoke or abrogate. See <hi>Grotius</hi> on the place. But this was not according to the mode of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchs, and haply they might think to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate themselves the more with <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> by cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a decree from him after the mode of his own Countrey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. <hi>Darius signed the Writing,</hi> it having such a shew of convenience from the common suffrage of all his Grandees and Ministers of State, as very requisite for the begetting an awfull respect, and as it were a divine reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their Sovereign, and so to keep his Subjects in firm obedience. And he being old and timorous as well as lofty and ambitious might haply think it unsafe to resist the importunity of such a number of his Princes and Nobles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. Notwithstanding this Decree, <hi>Daniel,</hi> having a firm Faith in the God whom he served and a greater sense of his Glory than his own safety, held on his pious Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of praying to the God of <hi>Israel</hi> with his face turned toward <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and his Windows open and on his knees three times a day, Morning, Noon and Evening, being neither ashamed nor afraid to doe his wonted duty to his Maker maugre all the malice and subtilty of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. And now his enemies thought they had catcht him sure in the snare they had laid for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>Which altereth not.</hi> See verse 8. The forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49984:38"/>of such a Decree consists in signing it with the Seals of the King and his Nobles, as <hi>Grotius</hi> has noted on <hi>Esther,</hi> chap. 1. v. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. <hi>Of the Children of the Captivity.</hi> This is put into the charge to aggravate <hi>Daniel</hi>'s fault, that he being but a Captive in a strange land should be so presumptuous as so openly to transgress such a solemn and earnest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the King as they pretended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. <hi>Was sore displeased with himself.</hi> It's likely as he was aged, so he was not so quick witted as to smell out their malitious project against <hi>Daniel</hi> at his signing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, though he discovered it now but too late. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be a seasonable monition to Monarchs and great Potentates, how they part with their own liberty by any Decree upon the importunity of their Grandees and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours, especially when there is any turpitude in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree they are earnest for, lest thereby they intricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in endless inconveniences, and be enslaved by them that ought to be their Subjects, and betray to utmost peril their most faithfull Friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. <hi>Assembled unto the King.</hi> The word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal [Ragash] is to assemble with some stir and tumult, which implies their earnest address to the King, and the vehemently and swaggeringly pressing the Immutability of the Decree, they having observed the King's inclination to to save <hi>Daniel.</hi> Know, O King, that the law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> is, that no Decree— be changed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. <hi>Then the King commanded,</hi> &amp;c. Being born down into it, by the importunate urging of the Immutability of the Decree, according to the law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> and though no law has a right to stand that is against the eternal law of God and Nature, yet <hi>Daniel</hi>'s enemies having this pretence, and the King being timid and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and aware of his own danger, if he should enrage the generality of his Grandees and Nobles by defeating their eager malice against <hi>Daniel,</hi> was forced to grant the request. For success gives a gloss to wicked Machinations, but to be defeated in a malitious design, the disappointment and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49984:39"/>shame would cast the designers into a fit of impatience and fury. <hi>Whom thou servest continually:</hi> That is, constantly, not onely praying to him duly every day thrice a day, but doing this even then, when thou art in peril of thy life for so doing. This shews the King to have been sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in granting the decree, and to disapprove of his own action, he being a Prince of much humanity, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a sense of piety also, though sway'd to things less a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable thereto through his own infirmity, and by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowering Politicks of his Courtiers. <hi>He will deliver thee.</hi> So he hopes upon his recalling to mind the deliverance of his three Countreymen out of the fiery furnace, and so wishes, out of his kindness to so pious a person and usefull a subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>That the purpose might not be changed.</hi> That the King might not change his purpose and save <hi>Daniel,</hi> for this end the Grandees sealed the stone; but the King, that the Grandees might not murther <hi>Daniel</hi> some other ways, if the Lions forbare him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 18. The good-natur'd Prince did not conceal his solicitude and affection for his faithfull subject <hi>Daniel,</hi> though of another Religion from his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 20. <hi>With a lamentable voice. Voce lacrymabili</hi> the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine has it. He spake to him with tears down his cheeks, and a tone answerable thereto. Which is no <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum</hi> in this benign Prince, <hi>Homer</hi> bringing in his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Heroes weeping upon occasion. And what <hi>David</hi> did upon the death of <hi>Absolon</hi> all know. <hi>Servant of the living God.</hi> Not of stocks, or stones, or metals of what value soever, who can neither save themselves nor others. <hi>Able to deliver thee.</hi> For <hi>Parius</hi> did not at all question his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness, being himself of so good and benign a nature, and knowing what a faithfull and constant worshipper <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> was of his God. And <hi>Darius</hi>'s neither Philosophy nor Religion reached so far yet as to know that the God of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> was the Omnipotent Maker of heaven and earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 22. <hi>My God has sent his Angel.</hi> As there was an Angelical appearance in the fiery furnace that saved the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49984:39"/>three children from harm. <hi>And hath shut the Lion's mouth.</hi> This is that which the Apostle alludes to, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.33. Who <hi>by faith</hi> stopped the mouths of Lions, quenched the violence of fire. For their <hi>faith</hi> in God procured this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical assistence to the three children in the fiery furnace, and to <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lion's den. Nor was <hi>Daniel</hi>'s faith presumption, he being so holy and innocent a person as is intimated in the residue of the verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 23. <hi>Because he believed in his God.</hi> His faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stopped the mouth of the Lions, as the Apostle above declares.</p>

But that their wives and children as well as the Accusers themselves were cast into the Lion's den, this was the excess of indulgence to a just rage and indignation against so horrid a villany com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against so holy and innocent a person, and so dear to <hi>Darius</hi> the King.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>ARG. Daniel<hi>'s Vision, in the first year of</hi> Belshazzar, <hi>of four Beasts betokening four Kingdoms or Empires. The everlasting Kingdom of God or Christ raised within the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of these four Kingdoms; as is farther understood by a full interpretation of the Vision to</hi> Daniel <hi>by an Angel.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the first year of Belshazzar King of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Daniel spake, and said, I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And four great beasts came up from the sea, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers one from another.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The first was like a Lion, and had Eagles wings: and I beheld till the wings thereof were pluckt, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a mans heart was given to it.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:49984:40"/>
               <p n="5">5 And behold, another beast, a second, like to a Bear, and it raised up it self on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</p>
               <p n="6">6 After this I beheld, and lo, another like a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl, the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</p>
               <p n="7">7 After this I saw in the night-visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadfull and terrible, and strong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it; and it was divers from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.</p>
               <p n="8">8 I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns pluckt up by the roots: and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</p>
               <p n="9">9 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wooll: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.</p>
               <p n="10">10 A fiery stream issued, and came forth from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: thousand thousands ministred unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
               <p n="11">11 I beheld then, because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49984:41"/>beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</p>
               <p n="12">12 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed for a season and time.</p>
               <p n="13">13 I saw in the night-visions, and behold, one like the son of man, came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</p>
               <p n="14">14 And there was given him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations and langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that which shall not be destroyed.</p>
               <p n="15">15 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</p>
               <p n="16">16 I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this: so he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</p>
               <p n="17">17 These great beasts, which are sour, are four Kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</p>
               <p n="18">18 But the Saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was divers from all the others, exceeding dreadfull, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass, which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet,</p>
               <p n="20">20 And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell, even of that horn that had eyes, and a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49984:41"/>mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.</p>
               <p n="21">21 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the Saints, and prevailed against them;</p>
               <p n="22">22 Untill the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the Saints of the most High; and the time came that the Saints possessed the kingdom.</p>
               <p n="23">23 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be divers from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</p>
               <p n="24">24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom, are ten Kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them, and he shall be divers from the first, and he shall subdue three Kings.</p>
               <p n="25">25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the Saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand, untill a time and times and the dividing of time.</p>
               <p n="26">26 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume, and to destroy it unto the end.</p>
               <p n="27">27 And the kingdom and dominion, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the Saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</p>

For Prophetical Visions are communicated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, either sleeping or waking, and they are either way truly <hi>divine.</hi> The summ of the matters of which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine dream <hi>Daniel</hi> set down in writing, and declared as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in verse 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that is here done still in the Chaldee tongue, this Vision of the <hi>four beasts</hi> answering so accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that of the Statue of <hi>four metals,</hi> and therefore for the greater satisfaction and confirmation of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof, this divine Vision or dream is put into the same language, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Syriack</hi> or <hi>Chaldee</hi> as an Appendage to that brief Chaldee <hi>Chronicle</hi> of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kings, and the affairs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to wit, of the most notable things that happened betwixt them from the time of <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s dream of the Metalline Statue, to the reign of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> inclusively.</p>

By the <hi>great Sea</hi> in this place, according to the prophetick style, are understood vast multitudes of people that overspread the face of the earth, as the waters of the Sea doe. By the <hi>Winds,</hi> which are invisible, are understood either the <hi>Invisible Powers,</hi> viz. the Aerial Genii or Angels, which are called <hi>Ruchoth venti,</hi> Zach. 6. and Psalm 104.4. or else the ambitious and unquiet minds of great Princes and Politicians with their Grandees and Ministers of State, and those blusters they make in the world by their impetuous activity to begin or increase their dominion, and to enlarge it into a more absolute Empire.

These <hi>four</hi> great <hi>Beasts</hi> are the same four Empires that were prefigured by the Statue of <hi>four metals,</hi> the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian, Medo-Persian, Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman.</hi> And in that they are represented as coming up from the Sea, it is a sign the Vision reaches the Original or beginning of every one of them. But their coming out of the Sea <hi>together,</hi> is not that they rose all at once, but is so expressed to strike the fancy more strongly, which is the embellishing of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Prophecy. And though they be said to be divers one from another, yet all agree in this, that they are <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>wild Beasts,</hi> by which is understood their <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> notes out of <hi>Jacchiades.</hi> Which cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of these four <hi>wild Beasts</hi> is exquisitely well opposed unto the Kingdom of the <hi>Son of man,</hi> all along distinct from the other four Kingdoms, who came to erect the Empire of Love and Charity, and of pure Religion, the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Father in spirit and in truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. This first Beast, a Lion, is the <hi>Babylonian</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and <hi>Nebuchednezzar</hi> is described in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> by this animal. See <hi>chap.</hi> 4.7. and his Eagles wings betoken the quickness of his dispatch in his expeditions and conquests, expressed also in the same Prophet by the flight of an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.13. and <hi>chap.</hi> 40. They may denote also the haughtiness of his spirit, of which <hi>Isaiah</hi> taxes him, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 14. which pride and haughtiness his Grandchild <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar</hi> did also inherit, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.25. nor can <hi>Darius</hi> that succeeded him be excused from pride that he so easily swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down the motion for the decree his Princes suggested to him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.7. And the whole succession of the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> and the Kingdom under them being lookt upon but as one Beast by a Prophetick <hi>Henopoeia,</hi> whatever befell any particular King is referred to the Beast. To the pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore of the Lion's wings wherewith he was lifted from the earth is referred <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s dejection, when instead of being lifted up on high with his wings from the earth he was seen to graze on the ground with Oxen. The wings also of the Lion were pluckt in his Son <hi>Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merodack</hi>'s days, when <hi>Media</hi> by <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s rebellion against <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styages</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:49984:43"/>was rent from the Kingdom of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously pluckt in what befell his Grandchild <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> who was humbled with a witness at the hand-writing on the Wall, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.6. But now, lastly, the Lion standing on his feet as a man, to this particularly is referred <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>'s recovery out of his <hi>Boanthropy,</hi> when out of the depravedness of his imagination he was seen to go on all four like a beast. But the man's heart signifying the use of reason and humanity, this is referrable not onely to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s recovery out of his delirancy, and to his humble professions touching the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> chap. 3.28. chap. 4.34. But to <hi>Evilmerodack</hi>'s good usage of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakim</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> Jer. 52.31. And <hi>Darius</hi> his singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar humanity and kindness to <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 6. v. 14, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These Characters, and for that these four Beasts answer to the four Metals in the Statue, and that the Golden head there is certainly the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kingdom, may assure us that the <hi>Lion</hi> is also the same Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. The Lion being the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> the succession of the four Empires in History will secure us that the Bear is the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Empire, so that it is needless to note that <hi>Persia</hi> is notorious for breeding the fiercer sort as well as great plenty of those Animals, or that the <hi>Persians</hi> resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Bear in their abstinence and hardship. But this Bear is said to raise its self on one side, because dividing the World into two parts, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs were kind to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and exercised their Hostility onely against the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> See <hi>Isa.</hi> chap. 44.28. The three ribs in the mouth of the Bear, according to some, is <hi>Persia, Media</hi> and <hi>Chaldea,</hi> according to others the three coasts of the world subdued by the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchs, by <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Eastern</hi> part, by <hi>Cambyses</hi> the <hi>Southern,</hi> viz. <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and by <hi>Darius Hystaspis</hi> the <hi>Northern,</hi> namely the <hi>Scythians.</hi> And that voice bidding it devour much flesh, is the instigation of them by divine Fate to be a scourge to the wicked world, the civilized parts especially, which were grown rich and luxurious, to make a spoil of their riches, which in the <hi>Onirocriticks</hi> is understood by flesh; which was
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49984:43"/>notably fulfilled in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his vanquishing <hi>Croesus</hi> King of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and <hi>Belshazzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon.</hi>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. Succession here again will assure us that this is the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, because the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> was put an end to by <hi>Alexander,</hi> whose victories with his armies were so swift, that in this regard a <hi>Leopard</hi> is a fit Symbol of this Empire, that Animal, besides the extraordinary swiftness of it, jumping upon his prey, as Naturalists observe. And there was a wonderfull dispatch in <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Conquests, who in the space of six years subdued not onely all <hi>Asia,</hi> but a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africk.</hi> The four wings on the back of this Leopard, <hi>as wings,</hi> denote also the celerity of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Conquests and speedy division of his Empire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four Kingdoms, which the wings <hi>as four</hi> prefigure. Which is also prefigured by the <hi>four heads,</hi> as the division of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire into ten Kingdoms by <hi>ten horns,</hi> and it was still one <hi>Greek</hi> Kingdom, as the other one <hi>Roman.</hi> For one Beast can stand but for one Kingdom. Those four heads that succeeded <hi>Alexander,</hi> were <hi>Cassander,</hi> to whom was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted the Kingdom of <hi>Macedonia; Ptoleceus Lagi Fil.</hi> to whom <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Africk; Lysimachus,</hi> to whom <hi>Thracia;</hi> and <hi>Antigonus,</hi> to whose share <hi>Asia minor</hi> fell, according to <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus.</hi> And that dominion is said to be <hi>given</hi> to this Leopard, it seems to imply that <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Conquests were so marvellous, that the Empire he acquired was rather a mere gift of Divine Providence, than any Acquist by his own strength, policy or vigilancy. See Dr. <hi>H. More</hi> on the place.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>In the night-visions.</hi> In this divine or superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural dream communicated to <hi>Daniel</hi> from God. <hi>A fourth Beast;</hi> which is the fourth Empire, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> for what Empire should succeed the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Macedonick</hi> Empire but the <hi>Roman,</hi> that vanquished it as the <hi>Greek</hi> the <hi>Persian,</hi> and the <hi>Persian</hi> the <hi>Babylonian.</hi> That this <hi>fourth</hi> Kingdom is the <hi>Roman</hi> is demonstrated against <hi>Grotius</hi> Synops. Prophet. Book 2. Chap. 13. And as this Kingdom is typified, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. by the iron legs of the Image, so the strength of it here is set out by its great <hi>iron teeth.</hi> Both import that it is <hi>strong
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49984:44"/>exceedingly.</hi> For so is that metal. And the courage, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and exceeding largeness of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire must needs make it <hi>dreadfull</hi> and <hi>terrible.</hi> And for the enormous cruelty of this Empire, which was found so salvage that no one <hi>species</hi> of wild Beast could sufficiently set out the direfulness thereof while <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Paganochristian,</hi> the horrid persecution of the Primitive Christians, and that no less of the <hi>Evangelici</hi> under the <hi>Papacy,</hi> is too ample and astonishing a monument. <hi>And stamped the residue with the feet.</hi> What it could not tear in pieces with its iron teeth, and so swallow down and digest into its body, and so make it part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: by the extreme parts of the Empire which answer to the feet, it grievously annoyed and harassed, abetting any that would infest and invade those people that they found so refractory, and giving them as a spoil to them, <hi>&amp;c. Divers from all the beasts.</hi> Forasmuch as they being absolute Monarchies, this fourth Beast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of two Consuls and a Senate, and in after-times of a mingle-mangle of Popes and Emperours, <hi>&amp;c. And it had ten horns,</hi> answering to the <hi>ten toes</hi> of the iron legs of the Image. These ten Horns must be the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ten Kingdoms after the Empire became Christian, and was beginning to Paganochristianize, and grow Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous again. This therefore is the Time, and there the ten Horns of the Beast.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>I considered the Horns.</hi> Which is said to excite us to a close consideration of these Horns to see what we can espy there. And there we may observe another little Horn come up amongst them, but different from the rest. This therefore is an Additional to the ten Horns here as the <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horned</hi> Beast and the <hi>Whore</hi> are Additionals to the ten-horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beast, <hi>Apoc.</hi> chap. 13. and 17. Which most peculiarly is the Papal Polity or Hierarchy. But <hi>the three first horns, i. e.</hi> of the first kind or first mentioned which were pluck'd up before him, that is, removed out of the Pope's sight, is the Power, 1. of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours extending into <hi>Italy;</hi> 2. of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and 3. of the <hi>Franks</hi> continued in the Empire of <hi>Germany.</hi> All these three Powers or Horns
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49984:44"/>he made shift to rid himself of, that he might the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily domineer in <hi>Italy</hi> without any corrival. But this was not till he had grown to that rampancy of power, that he would excommunicate and depose Kings and Emperours, and had made himself in effect sole Emperour of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And in that it is said, that in this Horn were <hi>eyes like the eyes of a man;</hi> this shews a notorious difference betwixt <hi>this</hi> Horn and the other <hi>ten,</hi> and that he would prove the guide and ruler of the rest, themselves being destitute of sight; and the Papal Hierarchy how cunning and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted a Polity it has been all History rings thereof, and how far they pretend and how active Assistents they are even in civil affairs. But it is yet a more peculiar charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of distinction betwixt this <hi>Hierarchical</hi> power in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the <hi>Secular</hi> of the ten Kings, in that in matters of Faith and Religion they are to have no eyes of their own, but to profess and believe as this <hi>Horn,</hi> who pretends to have the <hi>onely eyes,</hi> tells them, and so to be led in a blind implicit faith, to believe and profess any thing that makes for the power, wealth and honour of the Popedom. And lastly, though this little Horn pretend to the onely true insight and infallibility in matters of Religion, as if he were inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from <hi>God,</hi> yet the Prophecy insinuates, that they are but the eyes of a <hi>Man,</hi> and are so called, and consequently of that <hi>Man of sin</hi> or Antichrist, that exalts himself above all that is called God or worshipped. And the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers generally understand this little Horn of Antichrist. And that character of <hi>a mouth speaking great thing,</hi> nothing can be more fitly apply'd than this to the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they are set out by their <hi>Canonists</hi> and other displayers of their greatness. See Bishop <hi>Downham</hi> in his Treatise <hi>de Antichristo,</hi> Part 1. lib. 4. that whole fourth Book, or Dr. <hi>H. More,</hi> what he has culled thence on this place.</p>

The Ancient of days here is God the Father, who though he is not before the other two <hi>Hypostases</hi> of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49984:45"/>blessed Trinity in time, yet he is in order of nature. The <hi>whiteness</hi> of the <hi>hair</hi> of his head denotes mature counsel and judgment, with a sutableness to his title of the Ancient of days, and the <hi>whiteness</hi> of his <hi>garment</hi> is pure unspotted righteousness, and impartiality in judging of causes. His <hi>throne</hi> like a <hi>fiery flame,</hi> and <hi>wheels</hi> like <hi>burning fire,</hi> is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Divine <hi>Shechinah,</hi> not much unlike that in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> chap. 1. and 10. This is a Chariot-like Throne, as that a Throne-like Chariot; and as the wheels there as well as the living creatures are Angelical, so there are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels here innumerable in this great Session sitting with the Ancient of days, or assisting while he sits on his Imperial Throne drawn with wheels, Angelical wheels, by whose ministry is the Revolution of all States and Kingdoms.</p>

And herefore is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that blast of fire and flaming breath, 2 <hi>Esdr.</hi> 13. and suits excellently well with that passage, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. that tells us that the Lord will consume Antichrist with the spirit of his mouth, and destroy him with the brightness of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This may denote the operation of the spirit which is resembled to fire, and the stream coming forth from the Ancient of days be a Symbol of the procession of the Holy Ghost, which proceeds from the Father as well as from the Son. But whereas it is said, <hi>the Books were opened.</hi> This corresponds with <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.11, 12. and reaches to the final Judgment immediately preceding the Conslagration, and then the fiery stream out of the mouth of the Ancient of days will call also for another sense (for one Symbol in the same Prophecy sometimes signifies more things than one) it will signifie that final Sentence, <hi>Depart from me ye accursed into everlasting fire.</hi> See <hi>Isa.</hi> 30.33.</p>
                  <p>

For that Hierarchichal Polity, or Papal Hierarchy which is this little Horn, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters such things as these. That the Pope is above all Kings and Emperours. That by certain words they can turn a piece of bread into a man, nay into a God in a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49984:45"/>manner. That they can consecrate Images to effectually keeping off thunder and lightning, and the incursion of enemies. That the Pope is the supreme Deity on earth. That his Tribunal and God's is all one. That he has the disposing of Kingdoms, can pull down one and set up another. That he can change the nature of things, make Injustice Justice, and Wrong Right. That it is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege to doubt of his power. That he has dominion over Angels, Purgatory and Hell. See Bishop <hi>Downham</hi> in the Book above-cited. <hi>I beheld even till the Beast was slain,</hi> and with the Beast the false Prophet, for that in an Elliptical way is intimated and supplied in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> chap. 19.20. And the Beast was taken and with him the false Prophet, which is this little Horn. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to these words of <hi>Daniel, His body was destroyed and given to the burning flame,</hi> which intimates the means by which he was slain and destroyed, these things come to pass under the seventh Vial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. As if he should say, If any one shall be so cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as to enquire what became of the rest of the Beasts, the other three above-mentioned, let that suffice that their dominion was taken away, and that they had their set periods of time allowed them by the doom of the Ancient of days. This is enough as touching them, but the great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of all is touching the fourth Beast the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, forasmuch as the true Church of Christ for so long a space of time is so much concerned therein, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that deserves more special observation and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore he holds on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. <hi>Like the Son of man.</hi> The Son of man is a Title which Christ so inculcatedly assumes to himself, to whom the Kingdom does belong, that it is impossible but that he should have a regard to this very place in his so perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually using that style touching himself. And therefore it being Christ, it is plain that the second <hi>Hypostasis</hi> of the holy Trinity is here exhibited in this divine Vision as well as the first and third; as I have noted they all three
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49984:46"/>are in the Vision of <hi>Ezekiel. Came with the clouds of heaven.</hi> This passage our Saviour seems to allude to in his answer to the high Priest, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.64. where he tells him, <hi>He shall see the Son of man coming in the coulds of heaven.</hi> And to be carried in the clouds of heaven, denotes that a King shall be master of his enemies and get glorious Victory, saith <hi>Achmetes.</hi> Christ therefore coming as it were in the head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, to destroy the murtherous Jews and establishing thereby his Church or Kingdom in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire especially, fulfilled his own prediction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. Some of all people shall serve him in the pure Apostolick way of doctrine and worship, and indeed the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in a manner did so for a while after <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Conversion, till the Apostasie came in. Which small interval of time in this Vision is not taken notice of, as being less considerable. But in the mean time it may be here reasonable to note, that this right of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being given to the Son of man, answers to the first Vision of the Seals, the Vision of the Heros on the white Horse, with a bow in his hand, and who had a Crown given unto him, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6.2. the right of the imperial Crown. <hi>Is an everlasting dominion.</hi> The true Church which is the genuine Kingdom of Christ and of which he alone is the Head, as being universal, never yet from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof has failed, nor ever will fail to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. <hi>Daniel</hi> was very anxious to know what the meaning of this Vision might be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. <hi>Daniel</hi> came to one of the assistent Angels in this great Session, not to those that were placed on Thrones; and asked him the <hi>plain</hi> meaning of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Parable, which he told him in manner as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. These four great Beasts are four Kings, with their Kingdoms or Empires, <hi>Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman.</hi> And they are said to arise out of the <hi>earth,</hi> as being but earthly Kingdoms minding earthly things here below, whenas the true Kingdom of Christ is heavenly-minded, and have their thoughts carried above
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49984:46"/>where Christ sits at the right hand of God. In all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood this is intimated by <hi>earth,</hi> else it would have been said as at first they rose out of the sea, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 18. The most High here seems to be Christ, who is called in the <hi>Apocalypse, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> This is to be fulfilled in his Millennial Empire, when the Kingdom of the <hi>Stone</hi> shall become the Kingdom of the <hi>Mountain,</hi> and sill the whole earth. And this Kingdom the Saints shall possess for ever and ever, that is, The true Church of Christ shall never fail till the end of the world. Thus far the Angel in general.</p>

That had a bold assured look, affecting the greatest grandeur imaginable, as pretending to be Lord of the whole world. In whose presence his Fellow-horns did but sneak, as whose stirrup they are fain to hold, even Emperours themselves as well as Kings and other Princes, when this little Horn is to ride on horseback, and to bear on their shoulders his chair when he will be carried in state, to hold the bason and towel when he washes his hands, and in publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies to sit at his feet, and if they will not be dutifull enough, to be troad upon by his feet, as <hi>Frederick Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barossa</hi> was served by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, who tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his neck in the sight of the people, with a big look and loud voice abused that of the Psalmist to his barbarous insultation over the Emperour. <hi>Super aspidem &amp; leonem ambulavis,</hi> &amp;c. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These hints are enough to shew how
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49984:47"/>fully this part of the Prophecy is accomplished, viz. <hi>Whose look was more stout than his Fellows.</hi>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 21. The same Horn, namely the little Horn, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Papal power by using the forces of the ten Horns, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power makes War against the Saints, the true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalick Church, that cannot close with the gross corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and idolatrous usages of the little Horn. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to that of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> chap. 13. <hi>v.</hi> 7. And it was given unto him to make War with the Saints, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. It is spoken there of the ten-horned Beast, as the <hi>Executioner</hi> of the War, but in <hi>Daniel</hi> of the little Horn, as the <hi>Instigator</hi> or Authorizer thereof. But this in the mean time is an evident sign, that the times of the <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn,</hi> are the times of the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beast <hi>healed,</hi> which are the times of the Apostasie of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 22. The little Horn wholly prevailed against the Saints till God so effectually convinced the world of the truth of their cause, that the Saints at the <hi>partial</hi> fall of the great City, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. got possession of part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom out of the hands of Antichrist, and in due time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the seventh Vial, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 16. and 19. will be seized of the rest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 23. The fourth Kingdom upon Earth is the <hi>Roman</hi> State or Empire, which is said to be <hi>divers</hi> from all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as having a political Constitution differing from them, as has been noted above, and to <hi>devour the whole earth,</hi> in regard of its vastly extended Conquests, which therefore ill suits with <hi>Grotius</hi> his conceit, that it is the Kingdom of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae.</hi>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 24. <hi>And another shall arise after them.</hi> Another King shall arise immediately after them, or shall arise behind them. For so the Seventy render it, and the Hebrew word may signifie so, and intimate that this little Horn, the Pope or Papal power, so arose as if he had stoln his growth behind the ten Horns, they not being aware of him, as having no eyes, but he the eyes of a Man, of a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning perspicacious Politician. And this King is said to be <hi>divers</hi> from the rest, as being <hi>Rex Sacrorum</hi> an <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:49984:47"/>Potentate, but the other ten Kings <hi>Laicks</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates. And those three Kings which he is said to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, subdue or supplant are three whose dominions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended into <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Leo Isaurus</hi> the Greek Emperour, whom he excommunicated and made his Subjects of <hi>Italy</hi> revolt from their Allegiance because he was against Image-worship. The <hi>Lombards,</hi> whose Kingdom he caused by aid of the <hi>Franks</hi> to be wholly ruinated to get the Exarchate of <hi>Ravenna</hi> for a Patrimony to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And lastly, the Emperours of <hi>Germany,</hi> whom from the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth he excommunicated, deposed and trampled under his feet, and never suffered to live in rest till he had made them quit their Interest in the Election of Popes and Investiture of Bishops, and what ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of Jurisdiction they had in <hi>Italy.</hi> See Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> Epist. 24. Thus did this Horn with eyes whose look was more stout than his Fellows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 25. <hi>Shall speak great words.</hi> The Original has onely [words] but [great] is safely added from what occurs, <hi>v.</hi> 8.11, 20. And <hi>Apoc.</hi> chap. 13. v. 5, 6. may be a fit Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on those passages. And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and Blasphemies. Where <hi>great things</hi> is expounded by <hi>Blasphemies.</hi> But here it is sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to note, how well the deeds of the little Horn suit with those of the ten-horned healed Beast, who is but the Abettour and Executioner of what the two-horned Beast would have. And therefore when it is said the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn here speaks great words against the most High, it is all one, as if it were said of the ten-horned Beast in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> For this which is said of the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beast is to be lookt upon as the mere <hi>Echo</hi> of the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conick voice,</hi> of the Beast with <hi>two Horns,</hi> who is the maker of the Image of the Beast, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. as the <hi>Echo</hi> is the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>first voice.</hi> But he is said to <hi>wear out the Saints of the most High,</hi> viz. by Imprisonments, Consiscation of Goods, by Burnings, Croysades and Massacres, upon which this <hi>little Horn</hi> will put the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> as his occasions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And the sense of his intending to <hi>change times and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49984:48"/>laws,</hi> is his purpose of altering the primitive simplicity of the Christian Religion into a Constitution that best serves the Interest of his papal Kingdom. All superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons never so idolatrous, all doctrines never so monstrous, pass into a law and decree if they serve this end. This putting all therefore upon the little Horn here in <hi>Daniel</hi> does, as I intimated even now, answer to the two-horned Beast (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.) his making the Image of the old Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conick Beast, and causing the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to put on the hew again of Paganism. So admirably do these two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies give light one to another. And it being given into his hand to doe this for <hi>a time</hi> and <hi>times</hi> and <hi>half a time</hi> intimates that the ten Horns will assist and comply with him for such a time. And it is forty two months, equal to this time and times and half a time, that the ten-horned Beast is said to make War against the Saints. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13, &amp;c. See Dr. <hi>H.

I will shew thee the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the great Whore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And part of this Judgment is menaced against this <hi>Jezabel, Apoc.</hi> 2.20. and was fulfilled in the Reformation. And mention thereof again made, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 15.4. in those words. <hi>For thy Judgments are made manifest.</hi> And this is the former part of the execution of the Sentence against the little Horn or great Whore. But whereas it is said, they shall <hi>take away his dominion to consume and destroy it to the end,</hi> that intimates the execution going on in the seven Vials. By that time all the Vials be poured out upon the two-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Beast, the little Horn with eyes or the false Prophet, his dominion shall be quite destroyed or consumed, which is the second part of the executed doom on the little Horn, and will be completed under the seventh Vial, with which the Vision of that divine Heros on the white Horse, with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49984:48"/>a sword coming out of his mouth, doth Synchronize. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> on the place.</p>

And I think no body can doubt but that the people of the Saints of the most High are the truly Catholick and Apostolick Church, if we consider the description of the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> And the <hi>most High</hi> is Christ, who there is termed <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords,</hi> and the Messias will be acknowledged in those days to be such both by <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile. Whose Kingdom is an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdom,</hi> not to end upon earth till the last Thunder or Conflagration, according to the tenour of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse. And all dominions shall serve and obey him.</hi> All Nations and Kingdoms shall willingly submit themselves to, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy themselves in, this mightily extended and overspreading Kingdom of the Son of Man, which the Ancient of days had assigned to him. Which well may be called the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> in counter-distinction to those other four Kingdoms which are set out by cruel raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beasts, tearing and trampling all under their feet and forcing men to blind obedience with salvage violence, as was usual in the Kingdom of Antichrist or little Horn with eyes, that would let no body see but himself. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Kingdom of the Son of Man will be a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of unaffected Prudence, defecate Reason, and holy Love. For this is the true Man, the rest in us is but common to us with Brutes.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>ARG. Daniel<hi>'s Vision of the Ram and He-goat in the third year of</hi> Belshazzar, <hi>and of the pollution of the Sanctuary by the little Horn out of the He-goat for</hi> 2300 <hi>Evening-morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The Interpretation of the Vision by the Angel</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And I saw in a vision (and it came to pass when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the Palace, which is in the Province of Elam) and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, there stood before the river a Ram which had two horns, and the two horns were high: but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</p>
               <p n="4">4 I saw the Ram pushing west-ward, and north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and south-ward: so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand, but he did according to his will, and became great.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:49984:49"/>
               <p n="5">5 And as I was considering, behold, an he-goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table horn-between his eyes.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And he came to the Ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And I saw him come close unto the Ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the Ram, and brake his two horns, and there was no power in the Ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the Ram out of his hand.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Therefore the he-goat waxed very great, and when he was strong, the great horn was broken: and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And it waxed great, even to the host of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and it cast down some of the host, and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Yea, he magnified himself even to the Prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice, by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground, and it practised, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Then I heard one Saint speaking, and another Saint said unto that certain Saint which spake, How
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49984:50"/>long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be troden under foot?</p>
               <p n="14">14 And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And I heard a mans voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</p>
               <p n="17">17 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for at the time of the end shall be the vision.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</p>
               <p n="19">19 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.</p>
               <p n="20">20 The Ram which thou sawest having two horns, are the Kings of Media and Persia.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And the rough Goat is the King of Grecia, and the great horn that is between his eyes, is the first King.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not in his power.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressours are come to the full, a King of fierce
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49984:50"/>countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</p>
               <p n="24">24 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and practise, and shall destroy the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the holy people.</p>
               <p n="25">25 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand, and he shall magnifie himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of Princes, but he shall be broken without hand.</p>
               <p n="26">26 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told, is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision, for it shall be for many days.</p>
               <p n="27">27 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the Kings business, and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.</p>

In the third year of <hi>Belshazzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and immediate predecessour to <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> a Vision appeared to <hi>Daniel,</hi> not in his sleep but when he was awake, and up and abroad, about three years after that which he saw at first, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. Here is mention of this <hi>Shusan</hi> or <hi>Susa,</hi> being in the Province of <hi>Elam,</hi> that is, <hi>Elymais,</hi> because <hi>Elam</hi> is the name of the <hi>Persian</hi> people, and that Empire so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Vision. And the River <hi>Ʋlai</hi> is that which Historians and Geographers call <hi>Ʋlceus Fluvius,</hi> which rises in <hi>Media,</hi> touches upon <hi>Susa,</hi> and at last discharges it self into the <hi>Persian</hi> gulf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>Daniel</hi>'s saying he lift up his eyes and saw, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally implies that he was awake, and that it was not a Night-vision but a Day-vision, and that he was really by the River <hi>Ʋlai,</hi> and had some charge there in <hi>Susiana,</hi> it may be conferr'd on him by <hi>Evilmerodack,</hi> and continued in <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar</hi>'s reign at least till that time. The Ram which he there saw denotes the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Empire, from a Parono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastical allusion which the Hebrew word (that signifies both <hi>stoutness</hi> and <hi>courage,</hi> and also a Ram) has to <hi>Elam</hi> the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> people. It denotes also the richness of the <hi>Persian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours according to <hi>Achmetes.</hi> And lastly, this more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Symbol seems to be made use of by reason of their kindness to the Jews. But by the <hi>two horns</hi> are denoted <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> and by the higher that came up last the <hi>Persian</hi> power, which, though later, was greater than that of the <hi>Medes.</hi>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. The He-goat denotes the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, <hi>v.</hi> 21. and there are several reasons that it should do so. For the <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Macedonians</hi> (and <hi>Alexander</hi> himself is called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Macedo</hi>) were anciently called <hi>Aegeatae,</hi> which is as much as to say, the <hi>Goat-people.</hi> And the words in the Original, which are here rendred an <hi>He-goat,</hi> properly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a <hi>young He-goat,</hi> denoting <hi>Alexander</hi>'s youngness when he first enterprized the Conquest of the Eastern Empire, he being not much past twenty years old. The <hi>clambring</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Goat intimates also the aspiring ambition of <hi>Alexander.</hi> And the <hi>Goat</hi> is look'd upon as a more ready witted Animal than the <hi>Ram</hi> or Sheep, and how Philosophy and long Beards, like those of Goats, flourished in <hi>Greece,</hi> is notoriously known. But this Goat is said to come <hi>from the West,</hi> because <hi>Greece</hi> is West of <hi>Persia,</hi> and on the <hi>face of the whole earth,</hi> because of the vast overspreading of his victories, and <hi>not to touch the ground,</hi> by reason of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary speed of his Conquests. And the word that is rendred He-goat here, is derived from a Hebrew root that signifies <hi>to fly,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> over-ran and vanquished the <hi>Persians,</hi> the <hi>Medes,</hi> the <hi>Fabylonians</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> with the neighbouring Nations in the space of six years. Which <hi>Alexander</hi> therefore is that notable Horn between the Goat's eyes. That <hi>one</hi> great <hi>Horn</hi> upon this <hi>one Goat,</hi> upon which grew four lesser afterwards.</p>

But though the Goat was grown thus strong, yet his great Horn was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, for all his greatness dyed about the two or three and thirtieth year of his age, as some say being poisoned. And after this Horn was broken upon this one self-same Goat, came up <hi>four notable ones,</hi> not in respect of the <hi>first,</hi> but in respect of the rest of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>'s Captains, amongst whom the Empire was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded after his death. Which four notable Horns were <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus</hi> the Son of <hi>Lagus,</hi> Sovereign of <hi>Aegypt, Lysimachus</hi> of <hi>Thracia, Antigonus</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Cassander</hi> the Son of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater</hi> Sovereign of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> These possess'd these four parts of the Empire towards the four winds of Heaven, <hi>viz. Aegypt</hi> in the South, <hi>Thracia</hi> in the North, <hi>Macedonia</hi> in the West, and <hi>Asia</hi> in the East, the fite of these four Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities thus compared one with another.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. The little Horn that came out of one of these notable Horns, is the Kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> which grew up out of the favour and aid of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> King of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> But <hi>Seleucus</hi> so small at first, after <hi>Antigonus</hi> King of <hi>Asia</hi> by <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s help was vanquished and slain, and he and <hi>Ptolemy</hi> had divided the spoil, this <hi>Seleucus</hi> afterwards taking <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Son of <hi>Antigonus</hi> prisoner, got to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Empire of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Asia.</hi> So exceeding great did this little horn grow in <hi>Seleucus</hi> his time, but nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to this in <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> his. But though this little horn signifie the whole Succession of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> for the reason abovesaid, yet I deny not, but that it may more peculiarly aim at <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> the Jews being so much concerned in his reign, and that he may be also par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly said to wax great toward the South and toward the East; who toward the East overcame <hi>Artaxias</hi> King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:49984:52"/>and had over-run <hi>Aegypt</hi> also toward the South, but that at his siege of <hi>Alexandria, Popilius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Legate gave a stop to his affairs, which made him shew his power and vent his choler on <hi>Judaea</hi> called the pleasant land; and lastly, this <hi>Antiochus</hi> in his particular person may be called a <hi>little</hi> horn, because he was one of a mean fortune at first, a private man and an hostage at <hi>Rome.</hi>

And his <hi>casting down some of the Host and Stars to the ground,</hi> &amp;c. is the perverting some of the Priests and Levites (which should have been lights to others) and the Jews in general to embrace the customs of the Heathens (as you may see in the Books of <hi>Maccabees</hi>) whom he trod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very dirt and mire, at last, of abominable prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

He magnified himself even against the God of <hi>Israel</hi> himself, by taking away the Service he had appointed for himself, and by the bringing in the Idol of <hi>Jupiter Olympius</hi> into the Temple to take possession thereof, as if he intended to turn the true Owner out of doors, who abominates Idols, and has strictly forbid his people the worshipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. So that the place of his Sanctuary was debased from that height of Sanctity belonging to it before, by vile hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish prophanations, and sacrificing Swine's flesh on the very Altar. <hi>Joseph.

Such wicked practices of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> as these succeeded and obtained for a time, which are parallel to the feats of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> his keeping the holy Bible from the people, his Heathenizing them by compelling them to Pagan-like idolatries, and his persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, for not submitting thereto, that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the ancient Fathers so considently made <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> a type of Antichrist.

But haply this long-haired or long-bearded <hi>Goat</hi> may have a particular respect to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Army. None, says <hi>Justin,</hi> lead the files unless he were threescore years old; so if you viewed the fore part of the Army, you would take them to be the Senate of some ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. The long-bearded <hi>Sexagenarii</hi> appeared in the fore part of the Army, as the Goats beard goes before the rest of his body. <hi>Is the first King.</hi> This first King is most

From whence it necessarily follows, that there must be other horns, and other Kings to succeed in this body of the Goat or Greek Empire. This <hi>Grotius</hi> must allow whether he will or no.</p>

Now what a miserable and unnatural divulsion is there, that the Successours of those heads should be torn off from their Predecessours in those Kingdoms, to make a distinct Empire from the Greek, which is as wild and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant as to cut off the Leopards and Goats head with the horns to make two Goats, or two Leopards of them, or to make the body of each a distinct Animal from the Leopard or Goat. And yet this valiant exploit <hi>Grotius</hi> aims at, that he might excuse the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>fourth</hi> beast, and the Papal power the <hi>little Horn</hi> amongst the other <hi>ten. But not in his power:</hi> The four Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours of <hi>Alexander</hi> were neither so valiant as he in their own persons, nor was their Kingdom so strong by reason of the wars amongst themselves, they squabling one with another about the prey.</p>

In the latter time of the Kingdom of the four Kings, the Successours of <hi>Alexander,</hi> when the sins of the <hi>Jews</hi> shall be ripe for their Judgment, shall a King of a hard, bold and shameless countenance, and understanding dark sentences stand up. Whom all take to be <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and him to be a type of Antichrist. But in that it is said [in the latter time of the Kingdom] <hi>viz.</hi> of the four Kings, as they were at first, this does so manifestly tye the first four Kings to their Succession, even to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> his time, in as many of them as reached so far, that it is plain demonstration, that the Kingdom of the four horns doth extend it self into the times of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and that therefore the third Monarchy which is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49984:55"/>the <hi>Greek,</hi> reaches at least so far. Whereby <hi>Grotius</hi> his fond conceit of making the Kingdom of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae</hi> the fourth Empire, and the fourth beast is quite blown away. But now how well this <hi>boldness</hi> and <hi>skill</hi> in <hi>dark Sentences</hi> in the <hi>Type</hi> is answered in the <hi>Antitype,</hi> see Dr. <hi>H.

               <p>IN the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made King over the realm of the Chaldeans.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In the first year of his reign, I Daniel under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Jerusalem.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49984:56"/>my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God, keeping the covenant, and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</p>
               <p n="5">5 We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts, and from thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Neither have we hearkned unto thy servants the Prophets, which spake in thy name to our Kings, our Princes, and our Fathers, and to all the people of he land.</p>
               <p n="7">7 O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day: to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.</p>
               <p n="8">8 O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our Kings, to our Princes, and to our Fathers, because we have sinned against thee.</p>
               <p n="9">9 To the Lord our God belong mercies and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesses, though we have rebelled against him.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us, by his servants the prophets.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice, therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:49984:57"/>
               <p n="12">12 And he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us, and against our Judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done, as hath been done upon Jerusalem.</p>
               <p n="13">13 As it is written in the law of Moses, All this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day: we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</p>
               <p n="16">16 O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger, and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lords sake.</p>
               <p n="18">18 O my God, encline thine ear, and hear, open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:49984:57"/>
               <p n="19">19 O Lord hear, O Lord forgive, O Lord hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and do, defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city, and thy people are called by thy name.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God, for the holy mountain of my God:</p>
               <p n="21">21 Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.</p>
               <p n="22">22 And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.</p>
               <p n="23">23 At the beginning of thy supplications the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee: for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.</p>
               <p n="24">24 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and to make an end of sins, and to make recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem, unto the Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks; and threescore and two weeks the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.</p>
               <p n="26">26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah be cut off, but not for himself; and the people of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49984:58"/>the Prince that shall come, shall destroy the city, and the sanctuary, and the end thereof shall be with a sloud, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.</p>
               <p n="27">27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations, he shall make it desolate, even untill the consummation, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined shall be poured upon the desolate.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>Ʋnderstood by the Books.</hi> For there was in the hands of the Jews then the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that they might know their transgression, punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and time of appointed mercy. <hi>Came to Jeremy the Prophet.</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> chap. 25.11, 12. and chap. 27.7. and chap. 29.10. out of which places it is manifest that this <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity was but to continue 70 years, or till the reign of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Sons son, or Grandchild <hi>Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> who was slain in the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus. That
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49984:58"/>he would accomplish seventy years,</hi> and then relaxate their captivity. And therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> observing that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had now appeared prophesy'd of by <hi>Esay,</hi> chap. 44.28. and had cut off the race of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and reckoning from the time of his own captivity, and the beginning of the reigns of the Kings of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he did rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hopes that the day of their deliverance was now nigh at hand, and accordingly he betook himself to his devotions to hasten it as follows.</p>

Which singular piety of <hi>Daniel,</hi> all those that wait for the deliverance of God's people, from the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of the mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> should set themselves faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and conscientiously to imitate.</p>

Which holy desire is, as I said, a certain Divine Magick of the soul to attract the influencies
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49984:60"/>of the Spirit of God and the Ministry of Angels. <hi>Consider the Vision.</hi> This Prophecy of the seventy weeks is called a <hi>Vision</hi> in such a general sense as Prophets <hi>Seers,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> has rightly noted. And the matter of this Vision is well worth <hi>Daniel</hi>'s and our understanding and considering, it predicting the Jews enjoyment of their Religion for the space of about 500 years, and a Promise of the coming of their <hi>Messias</hi> for greater purposes than what respected the Jews onely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 24. <hi>Seventy weeks.</hi> That seventy weeks of years are understood, and that it is as much as if he shou'd have said 490 years, all Interpreters are agreed. But the very num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of these prophetick weeks seem not to want a mystery, it being made of 10 into 49, which is a Jubilee, and <hi>Ten</hi> a note of Perfection, and therefore this number denotes a most perfect Jubilee, the time of the coming of Christ, and of his redeeming for us our celestial Inheritance. <hi>Are determined upon thy people,</hi> &amp;c. that is to say, Near upon the expiration of the seventieth week the people of the Jews shall be no longer the people of God, nor their City holy, their Religion naturally ceasing upon some act of theirs, whereby a better, according to the purpose of God, shall be brought in. But from the commencement of the seventy weeks till that time, which is nigh 500 years, they should be the people of God, and their city accounted Holy, which is a fair space of time, and must be welcome news to <hi>Daniel. To finish transgression.</hi> To consume sin and make an end of it. For Christ came throughly to purge his floor, and to pluck up every plant that was not of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers planting. <hi>And to make an end of sins.</hi> Out of the Original it may be rendred to put an end to the Judaical Sin-offerings, <hi>viz.</hi> by Christ his being sacrificed on the Cross for the sins of the whole world. <hi>Reconciliation for iniquity.</hi> The Hebrew word signifies to expiate iniquity. And that Christ is that great expiation and atonement for sin, all true believers are agreed on. <hi>Everlasting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> such a Law or Religion as shall endure for ever, and according to which, if we live, it will be our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49984:60"/>not the works of <hi>Moses</hi>'s law, nor those offerings and sacrifices. This is the everlasting Gospel, mentioned, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14.6. <hi>And to seal up Vision and Prophecy,</hi> that is, To fulfill and accomplish the Prophecies, <hi>viz.</hi> those great important Prophecies concerning the Messiah. So the word <hi>Seal</hi> is used, Ezek. 28.12. <hi>And to anoint the most Holy,</hi> The most holy person that ever lived. The Jews themselves understood it of a person, <hi>Moses Gerundensis</hi> of the very Messiah. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> on the place.</p>

Wherefore, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.1. in the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his reign he obtained a decree for the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and re-building <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> For the other decrees granted by <hi>Cyrus, Darius Hystaspis,</hi> and by this <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> in the seventh year of his reign concerned onely the Temple, not the City and the Walls, as you may plainly discern by reading of <hi>Ezra.</hi> Whence it is manifest that the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the seventy weeks must be taken from this decree of the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> But how Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy is to be adjusted to this <hi>Epocha</hi> out of <hi>Tho. Lydiat,</hi> see Dr. <hi>H. More</hi>'s Notes on this Vision, and the first 16 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his <hi>Paralipomena Prophetica. Ʋnto Messiah the Prince, i. e.</hi> unto the manifestation of that person that is so well known, and so much expected by the Jews under the name of their Messiah (the word never being used absolutely but concerning him) to his entring into his ministry, being first baptized by <hi>John,</hi> and so shewing himself after in preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, and doing miracles for the confirmation thereof in the sight of all the people. To this manifestation of the Messiah or Christ <hi>shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks,</hi> i. e. 69 weeks, or 483 years. In the last of these years did Jesus the Messiah ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest himself. <hi>The streets shall be built again and the wall.</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:49984:61"/>This seems to be added on purpose to give light to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, that the decree here mentioned from whence the weeks do commence, is that granted in the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> because that was expresly for the City and the Walls, the other three preceding for the Temple. <hi>Even in troublesome times,</hi> As it appears out of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> chap. 4.

                     <hi>V.</hi> 26. <hi>And after threescore and two weeks,</hi> &amp;c. Namely, After the sixty two weeks that immediately succeed the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven weeks, that is, after sixty nine weeks, shall Messiah be cut off, <hi>viz.</hi> the above named Messiah the Prince, which term of Messiah is no where put absolutely but here, whence doubtlesly the Jews gave him, whom they expected for their redeemer, the name of Messiah <hi>cut off,</hi> which may signifie not onely from life, but as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> notes, from reigning as a King. And in respect of the Jews he was cut off in both those senses. For he was the Messiah their Prince, whom his own people rejected and cut off from life, and thereby from themselves, that they were no more his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor he their King. With which what follows, sitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. <hi>And they shall be none of his.</hi> For so the Hebrew is naturally rendred and not [but not for himself] The Messiah shall be cut off by the hand of the people of the Jews, and that people shall be none of his. <hi>Sed populus prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipis futurus</hi> (so the Hebrew is rightly and sutably rendred) But the people designed to be the people of Messiah the Prince hereafter (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> amongst whom Christ was chiefly to have his Church and Kingdom) <hi>shall destroy the City and the Sanctuary,</hi> namely, for their murthering the Messiah their Prince, which destruction was brought upon them by the <hi>Roman</hi> army under the conduct of <hi>Titus</hi> the Son of <hi>Vespasian. With a floud.</hi> After the destruction of the city the <hi>Roman</hi> army shall overflow <hi>Judaea,</hi> God determining that issue of the war the devastation of the land.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49984:61"/>grace should be won unto Christ, and close with the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Gospel. The word in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

But the main body of the Jews remained obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and were none of his people, as was noted above. And in that it is said, <hi>In the midst of the week he shall cause the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to cease;</hi> this implies the death of the Messiah on the Cross, which eminent sacrifice for the sins of the whole world put an end to or antiquated all other Sin-offerings. This passage therefore does more precisely predict the time of the Messiah's being cut off, <hi>viz.</hi> in the fourth year of the last week, or 487th year from the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> according to <hi>Tho. Lydiat</hi>'s Chronology. Which I conceive is the truest account. <hi>And for the overspreading of Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> &amp;c. Out of the Hebrew it is better rendred thus by Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> [And commanding over a wing of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he will be a destroyer] <hi>i. e.</hi> over an army of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Gentiles, the <hi>Roman</hi> army, who bore upon their stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards the Images of their Gods, which the Hebrew calls <hi>Abominations.</hi> And the coming of the <hi>Romans</hi> to destroy the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is in several places of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament called the coming of Christ. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his Exposition and Notes. <hi>Even untill the consummation,</hi> &amp;c. Reade out of the Hebrew. And untill the consummation (or the finishing this destruction) it shall continue upon the distressed, <hi>viz.</hi> This Wing of Abominations shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, or lye upon the distressed Jews. Wherefore as in the precedent, so in this verse upon the mention of Messiah his death or murtherous crucifixion by the Jews, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately is added a prediction of their destruction and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>ARG. <hi>In the third year of</hi> Cyrus, Daniel <hi>humbles himself with Prayer and Fasting for three weeks together. At the end of the three weeks an Angel in the High-Priests habit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to him, instructs, comforts and strengthens him, for the better receiving the ensuing Prophecy of the Scripture of Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the third year of Cyrus King of Persia, a thing was revealed unto Daniel, (whose name was called Belteshazzar) and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long, and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.</p>
               <p n="3">3 I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint my self at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel:</p>
               <p n="5">5 Then I lift up mine eyes, and looked, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a certain man cloathed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:</p>
               <p n="6">6 His body also was like the Beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:49984:62"/>
               <p n="7">7 And I Daniel alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees, and upon the palms of my hands.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thy self before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.</p>
               <p n="13">13 But the Prince of the kingdom of Persia with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood me one and twenty days: but lo, Michael one of the chief Princes came to help me; and I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there with the Kings of Persia.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:49984:63"/>
               <p n="15">15 And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my Lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.</p>
               <p n="17">17 For how can the servant of this my Lord, talk with this my Lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthned me,</p>
               <p n="19">19 And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not, peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong: and when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my Lord speak; for thou hast streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened me.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the Prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the Prince of Grecia shall come.</p>
               <p n="21">21 But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your Prince.</p>

                  <head>The NOTES.</head>
                  <p>THE Vision in this Chapter is onely Introductory to the Vision of the Scripture of Truth, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. as the three Visions of like vast extent of time and concern in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> have the like pompous Introductory Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions prefix'd to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>In the third year of Cyrus,</hi> &amp;c. In the third year of the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy, begun upon the death of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> who immediately succeeded <hi>Belshazzar</hi> the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar. Was called Belteshazzar.</hi> This name of <hi>Daniel,</hi> writ as it was at first, when <hi>Ashpenaz</hi> the Prince of the Eunuchs gave him it, signifies the <hi>Treasurer of the secrets of Bel,</hi> but, as it is here writ, it signifies an <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den enemy,</hi> viz. to the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Idolatry, though always a faithfull subject to the Kings of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as all good men are to their Princes, be they of what Religion they will. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> on the place. <hi>And the thing was true,</hi> i. e. The matter communicated to him was not <hi>Chidah</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Parable or Aenigm set out by types of a Statue of various Metals and of severally shaped Beasts, but it was <hi>Emeth,</hi> plain truth, without such mysterious riddles. <hi>But the time appointed was long,</hi> even from the beginning of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire to the end of the world. <hi>And he understood the vision,</hi> that is, the Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth.</hi> He understood it of himself, it wanting no interpretation as those Aenigmatical Prophecies did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>In those days,</hi> i. e. On a certain time of that third year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> after the adversaries of the Jews, notwithstanding the gracious decree of <hi>Cyrus</hi> had so prevailed with <hi>Cambyses</hi> his Son (his Father being busie in foreign Wars) as to hinder the building of the Temple; as it is recorded in <hi>Ezra</hi> chap. 4. That they hired counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia. Three full weeks.</hi> The Hebrew has
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49984:64"/>it three <hi>weeks of days,</hi> in counterdistinction to the seventy weeks in the foregoing Prophecy, which signifies <hi>weeks of years,</hi> and to intimate that days, weeks and years in any Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> unless something be hinted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, are to be understood of prophetical days, weeks and years. Which being an observable rule in <hi>Daniel</hi> the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>days</hi> for <hi>years</hi> hinders not, but this Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> may rightly be termed a <hi>plain</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>He eat no pleasant bread,</hi> &amp;c. those whole three weeks; though otherwise it was both lawfull for him and accustomary to use the diet of other Courtiers. To recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himself the more to God, and make himself more fit for prayer, contemplation and devotion, he eat no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>The great River which is Hiddekel.</hi> The vulgar Latine from the Septuagint calls it <hi>Tigris.</hi> It is called great, because of the breadth of it, as it touches on the Province <hi>Susiana,</hi> which <hi>Daniel</hi> was set over, and where he was at the sight of this Vision. It runs on the West-side of <hi>Ʋlai</hi> or <hi>Ʋlaeus,</hi> and by reason of its swiftness has its name from an Arrow, as <hi>Pliny</hi> notes, <hi>Tegir</hi> signifying an Arrow in <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi> and in the notation of <hi>Hiddekel</hi> the like swiftness is imply'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>A certain man cloathed in linen.</hi> This is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same Angel in humane shape that appeared unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> when he was near the River <hi>Ʋlai,</hi> which <hi>Calvin,</hi> not without reason, concluded to be Christ, called there <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moni.</hi> And that this here is Christ, will appear from his likeness to Christ in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> that appeared in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. For here this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is described cloathed in linen, that is, in the Pontifical Garment down to the foot. And so is Christ cloathed with linen, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.13. And as here the Angel is girt with the fine gold of <hi>Ʋphaz,</hi> so in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> Christ is girt with a golden girdle.</p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:49984:64"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. <hi>Like the Beryl.</hi> The Hebrew word is <hi>Tarsis,</hi> which signifies the Sea as well as <hi>Beryllus Thalassius,</hi> and therefore insinuates the party to be no private person but the Prince of a multitude. Which same thing is notify'd of Christ in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> though not by this Symbol of <hi>Tharsis</hi> or the <hi>Beryl.</hi> And as the face of this Angel has the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of lightning, so the Head of Christ is said to be as white as snow, which has a very dazling brightness in it, like that of lightning, which is also a white splendour, not red like sire. And as in this Vision the Angel's eyes are said to be as lamps of fire, so in that, Christ's eyes to be as a flame of fire, and as here the Angel's armes and feet are compared to polished brass, so the feet of Christ there to fine brass burning in a furnace. And brass brightned by rubbing or polishing, and purify'd by the fire, will sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the same thing. And, lastly, here it is said, And the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude, and in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> likewise, And his voice as the found of many waters, which in the prophetick style signifie a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. This Angel therefore being Christ, it is the very same <hi>Palmoni</hi> that appeared to <hi>Daniel</hi> near the River <hi>Ʋlai,</hi> chap. 8. bestirring himself in both places for the good of his people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>I Daniel alone saw the Vision,</hi> that is to say, He alone saw distinctly the Vision. But that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions saw something, is evident in that a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves, which plainly argues that this of <hi>Daniel</hi> was a real day-vision, and that he was in the place truly which he mentions, namely by the great River the River <hi>Hiddekel</hi> or <hi>Tigris</hi> in <hi>Susiana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>Therefore I was left alone and saw this great Vision.</hi> As being better sitted for such divine communion by his three weeks fasting and devotion. But well may this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be called <hi>great,</hi> it being the sensible and distinct pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord Christ. Whence he says there remained no strength in him, but his comeliness was turned into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, he being overcome and stounded at the presence of so glorious a Personage.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. <hi>Yet heard I the voice of his words.</hi> Though he was half dead in this strange consternation of mind, yet he heard the voice of this illustrious Angel that was present with him. But at the hearing the voice of his words he was so overcome and astonished thereat, as well as before at his sight, that it made him fall down into a soporiferous swound with his face towards the earth, his spirits did so fail him or quite retire through fear. See <hi>chap.</hi> 8.18. But the consopiting of the natural or carnal powers makes way for the seasonable weaking the Divine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>An hand touched me.</hi> When he was fallen thus to nothing in himself through perfect humiliation and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then an hand from without toucheth him, supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power then is conveyed to him; but by degrees. We must first learn to creep, and then go, as <hi>Daniel</hi> is here first set upon his knees, and the palms of his hands. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was a hopefull beginning, it being in virtue not of our own strength, but of that supernatural strength which will carry us out to the end if we be faithfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>A man greatly beloved.</hi> A man of desires, as I noted above, and so may denote a man of great love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and his people, or greatly beloved of God and all good men. <hi>And stand upright.</hi> Thus was <hi>Daniel</hi> roused up and enabled to hear, understand and take perfect notice of what was to be delivered unto him for the information of posterity. <hi>Am I now sent.</hi> The word in the Original is the same from whence <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the name of the Messias, is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which consists well with the supposing this Angel to be Christ. <hi>I stood trembling,</hi> by virtue of his saying unto me, Stand upright. I stood upon my legs, but trembled withall, as yet not being so thoroughly strengthened, or fearing what tidings this Angel might bring unto me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>I am come for thy words,</hi> that is, By reason of thy earnest and zealous prayer I am come unto thee. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the admirable efficacy of earnest and sincere devotion, that attracts to it not onely the ministry of Angels, but brings down into converse the Son of God himself.</p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:49984:65"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. <hi>Withstood me one and twenty days.</hi> Though thy petition was heard at the beginning of thy fasting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet I was so detained in my contest with the Presiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary Angel of the Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> that I could not come till now. And it is admirable to take notice of the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s prayers with the activity of the Invisible Powers for what he prayed for. <hi>Michael one of the chief Princes.</hi> This bringing in of <hi>Michael,</hi> one of the chief Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as assisting against the Prince of the Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> shews plainly that the Prince of the Kingdom of <hi>Persia</hi> is an Angel as well as <hi>Michael,</hi> this of <hi>Judea,</hi> the other of <hi>Persia;</hi> and that therefore there are Presidentiary Angels over all Nations. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> on the place. <hi>I remained there.</hi> The Original may be rendred, I was left alone there, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sent <hi>Michael</hi> elsewhere, upon whose return I was more free to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. <hi>Now am I come,</hi> having left <hi>Michael</hi> in my room, to give thee to understand what shall befall thy people for whom thou didst so earnestly intercede in thy devotions, not onely in reference to affairs more near at hand, but through the Series of many Ages, even to the end of all, what they shall suffer under the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, what under the <hi>Roman,</hi> and what an happy restoring there will be of them towards the end. For the Vision is for a long time, as it is said in the first verse. Which is a notable key for the right expounding of the Prophecy of the Scripture of Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. <hi>And became dumb.</hi> My astonishment from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beholden him was so great, and also from hearing his voice that I was not able to speak.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. <hi>The similitude of the sons of men,</hi> not in a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial body yet though in humane shape. <hi>Cornelius à La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide</hi> makes him the same Angel that communed with him all this time and a type of Christ, <hi>Calvin</hi> mentions some that make him Christ himself. <hi>Touched my lips,</hi> as he touched the tongue of the deaf and dumb man, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. and loosed it, that he could speak; as <hi>Daniel</hi> after the Angel had touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his lips, says, Then I opened my mouth, <hi>&amp;c. Retained no strength,</hi> so overcoming was the glorious presence of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49984:66"/>Messiah before he came in the flesh. These consternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mind in <hi>Daniel</hi> so often repeated, set off the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible eminency of the person he conversed with, and the huge weightiness of the matter that he was to convey unto <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>Of this my Lord.</hi> Out of the Original it may be rendred thus, How can <hi>this</hi> so vile a servant, so wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched poor and despicable a creature talk with such an one as <hi>this</hi> my Lord is? <hi>There remained no strength in me.</hi> So per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect an exinanition ought there to be of our own carnal mind and powers, for the fitting us to receive the superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power from God, and those divine communications that flow from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 18. After <hi>Daniel</hi> was thus lost and confounded in himself, and sound no strength of his own carnal will and mind left (that we may pursue the Moral Allegory of this Vision also) and after the free and hearty acknowledgment of the same, then Christ in humane shape here touched him again whereby he was strengthened. So great virtue is there in the touch of the divine body of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 19. <hi>Be strong, yea be strong.</hi> This is the voice of him, of whom it is said, He spake and it was done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and upon his speaking here, <hi>Daniel</hi> was strengthened, and being thus strengthened by this supernatural influence, took himself now to be an Auditor fitted for <hi>Palmoni</hi>'s informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and instructions.</p>
                  <p>

Thou canst not easily imagine, saith the Angel, what things, and of what mighty concern I have to impart unto thee. Which when I have imparted, I will return to dispute or contest with the Presidentiary Angel of <hi>Persia,</hi> and when I am gone forth I shall meet also with the Presidentiary An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of <hi>Grecia,</hi> for he will also put in for the Empire of the world. And this is the reason of the mentioning of the Prince of <hi>Grecia</hi> here.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 21. But now that I may enter upon what I came to thee for, I will declare in <hi>plain</hi> words, not in Symbols and Hieroglyphicks, as in the foregoing Prophecies, the Divine
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49984:66"/>Counsel or Purpose, so distinctly and orderly as if it were writ in a book. Which writing therefore here is called <hi>Scripture,</hi> and for its <hi>plainness</hi> and unsymbolicalness the <hi>Scripture of Truth.</hi> But there is none concerned with me in these things, none of the Presidentiary Angels of the Nations, but your Prince <hi>Michael,</hi> the Presidentiary Angel of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who is my General. Which farther confirms that this Angel is the same with <hi>Palmoni,</hi> and <hi>Michael</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Generalissimo under him, he must be the Lord of Hosts the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> viz. Christ as yet not incarnate.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ALso I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I stood to confirm and to strengthen him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And now will I shew thee the truth, Behold, there shall stand up yet three Kings in Persia, and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And a mighty King shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:49984:67"/>
               <p n="4">4 And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be pluckt up, even for others besides those.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And the King of the South shall be strong, and one of his Princes, and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion: his dominion shall be a great dominion.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And in the end of years they shall join them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together; for the Kings daughter of the South shall come to the King of the North to make an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement: but she shall not retain the power of the arme, neither shall he stand, nor his arme; but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times:</p>
               <p n="7">7 But out of a branch of her root shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the King of the North, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:</p>
               <p n="8">8 And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods with their princes, and with their precious ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of silver and of gold, and he shall continue mo years than the King of the North.</p>
               <p n="9">9 So the King of the South shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.</p>
               <p n="10">10 But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a multitude of great forces: and one shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up even to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And the King of the South shall be moved
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49984:67"/>with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the King of the North: and he shall set forth a great multitude, but the multitude shall be given into his hand.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up, and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthned by it.</p>
               <p n="13">13 For the King of the North shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come (after certain years) with a great army, and with much riches.</p>
               <p n="14">14 And in those times there shall many stand up against the King of the South: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision, but they shall fall.</p>
               <p n="15">15 So the King of the North shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities, and the arms of the South shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.</p>
               <p n="16">16 But he that cometh against him, shall do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.</p>
               <p n="17">17 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him: thus shall he do, and he shall give him the daughter of women corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.</p>
               <p n="18">18 After this shall he turn his face unto the Isles, and shall take many: but a Prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49984:68"/>without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Then he shall turn his face towards the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Then shall stand up in his state a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battel.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</p>
               <p n="22">22 And with the armes of a floud shall they be overslown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the Prince of the covenant.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And after the league made with him, he shall work deceitfully; for he shall come up, and shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come strong with a small people.</p>
               <p n="24">24 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the Province, and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers fathers, he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.</p>
               <p n="25">25 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the King of the South, with a great army, and the King of the South shall be stirred up to battel with a very great and mighty army: but he shall not stand; for they shall forecast devices against him.</p>
               <p n="26">26 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat, shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:49984:68"/>
               <p n="27">27 And both these Kings hearts shall be to do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Then shall he return into his land with great riches, and his heart shall be against the holy cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and he shall doe exploits, and return to his own land.</p>
               <p n="29">29 At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the South, but it shall not be as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or as the latter.</p>
               <p n="30">30 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do, he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.</p>
               <p n="31">31 And armes shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice; and they shall place the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination that maketh desolate.</p>
               <p n="32">32 And such as do wickedly against the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God, shall be strong, and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits.</p>
               <p n="33">33 And they that understand among the people, shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil many days.</p>
               <p n="34">34 Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</p>
               <p n="35">35 And some of them of understanding shall fall to try them, and to purge, and to make them white,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49984:69"/>even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.</p>
               <p n="36">36 And the King shall do according to his will, and he shall exalt himself, and magnifie himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be accomplished: for that that is determined, shall be done.</p>
               <p n="37">37 Neither shall he regard the god of his fathers nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnifie himself above all.</p>
               <p n="38">38 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his father knew not, shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.</p>
               <p n="39">39 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease with glory: and he shall cause them to rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many, and shall divide the land for gain.</p>
               <p n="40">40 And at the time of the end shall the King of the South push at him, and the King of the North shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots, and with horse-men, and with many ships, and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow, and pass over.</p>
               <p n="41">41 He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</p>
               <p n="42">42 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</p>
               <p n="43">43 But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49984:69"/>Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</p>
               <p n="44">44 But tidings out of the East, and out of the North shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.</p>
               <p n="45">45 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his Palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. THis first Verse of this Chapter should have been the last of the former, the sense is so closely connected thereto, which is this, I, even I <hi>Palmoni</hi> in the first year of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> stood to confirm and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then [him] that is to say <hi>Michael,</hi> as both <hi>Grotius</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expositors, as <hi>Calvin</hi> confesseth, refer [him] to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> according as is perpetually observed in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> that by Angels are understood the people over whom they preside, and so according to the Prophetick style he streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thning <hi>Daniel,</hi> and with him the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Gabriel,</hi> he strengthned <hi>Michael,</hi> that presided over them, it signifying the same thing, see <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>And now will I shew thee the truth.</hi> Now will I declare unto thee things to come in a <hi>plain</hi> intelligible way touching the Kingdoms of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Grecia,</hi> and also the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, not resembling the first to a Bear or Ram, the second to a Leopard or Goat, and the third to a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Beast with Iron teeth, but delivering the matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Prophetick Aenigm or Parable, you shall hear from me the bare truth in an easie and vulgar way. <hi>Yet three Kings in Persia,</hi> viz. <hi>Cambyses, Smerdis</hi> and <hi>Darius Hysta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spis,</hi> these three besides <hi>Cyrus</hi> the present King of <hi>Persia</hi> shall stand up. <hi>And the fourth shall be far richer than they all.</hi> This fourth is <hi>Xerxes,</hi> the same that is called <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49984:70"/>the book of <hi>Esther,</hi> and who married <hi>Esther</hi> the Jewish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and <hi>Herodotus</hi> calls his Queen <hi>Amestris,</hi> which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly has the sound of <hi>Esther</hi> in it. As for the Riches of this <hi>Xerxes</hi> or <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> in the book of <hi>Esther,</hi> he is said to have reigned from <hi>India</hi> even to <hi>Aethiopia</hi> over 127 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. And <hi>Justin</hi> lib. 2. writes of him, that though his army was so numerous that he drunk up whole Rivers, yet his Riches were so great that neither that Army nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasions of expence could ever exhaust them. <hi>He shall stir up all.</hi> For his Army he brought against <hi>Greece</hi> consisted of two thousand thousand six hundred forty one thousand six hundred and ten fighting men. And the Attendants of his Army that were to minister to them and others that went along with them, were as many at least as the fighting men: so that they were five thousand thousand two hundred eighty three thousand two hundred twenty in all. But for the number of the women to dress their meat, and of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezans and Eunuchs, of Waggon-horses and other Beasts of burthen, and of <hi>Indian</hi> Dogs, it was not to be told they were so many. See <hi>Herodotus</hi> lib. 7. cap. 186. So that by this account <hi>Xerxes</hi> may well be said to have stirred up <hi>all</hi> against the Realm of <hi>Grecia.</hi> Thus notably is this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Daniel</hi> fulfilled concerning this fourth King of <hi>Persia.</hi> But that the Prophecy proceeds no farther in this Catalogue of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> is because the Church is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Empire as to their sufferings, of which it was fit they should be forewarned. And this expedition of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who would have swallowed up all <hi>Greece,</hi> is a fit introduction to the expedition of <hi>Alexander</hi> against the <hi>Persians,</hi> as intimating the reasonableness of the success that was given him by Providence.</p>

And therefore he set forth a great multitude, seventy thousand foot and five thousand horse, and seventy three Elephants, and took many prisoners of the army of <hi>Antiochus Magnus.</hi> But the success of the day is much to be imputed to the courage and importunity of his Sister <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinoe.</hi> See the third book of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> chap. 1.</p>

And <hi>Philopator</hi> being dead, and <hi>Antiochus Magnus</hi> having made a firm league with <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he was assisted by him upon condition of equally dividing the spoil.

For this <hi>Antiochus</hi> was a great friend to the Jews that stuck to <hi>Moses</hi>'s law, as you may see in <hi>Josephus, And shall cast up a mount,</hi> against <hi>Sydon,</hi> where he shut up <hi>Scopas</hi> so close and long that he made him yield, and he took the fenced Cities, as was noted before out of <hi>Josephus.</hi> Nor could the Arms of the South, <hi>viz.</hi> those of those three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,

But of his entring of <hi>Judaea</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> I have hinted enough above. But whereas our English Version has it, which by his hand shall be <hi>consumed.</hi> The Original may be rendred, which by his hand shall be <hi>consummated</hi> or <hi>perfected,</hi> which is more agreeable to History, he being so great a friend and benefactor to the Jews.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>Antiochus</hi> not content with the regaining onely <hi>Coele-Syria</hi> and <hi>Judaea,</hi> which were his Ancestours before, has a design of making himself master also of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and to enter into the strength of <hi>Ptolemaeus Epiphanes</hi> his whole Kingdom, for so it may be rendred out of the Hebrew. <hi>And upright ones with him.</hi> The word in the Original may signifie either <hi>upright ones</hi> or <hi>covenants,</hi> but either are to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the match betwixt his daughter <hi>Cassandra</hi> and <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus Epiphanes. And he shall doe.</hi> So the Hebrew, that is, It shall succeed. He shall give him his daughter <hi>Cassandra,</hi> the fairest of women, and <hi>Coele-Syria, Phoenice, Judaea</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> for a dowry with her. <hi>Corrupting her,</hi> that is, infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing such principles into her as might make her instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal by treachery to her Husband, to get to her Father <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> But she shall not persist in such ways, as her Father would put herein, nor be for him, but be faithfull to her Husband.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 18. After <hi>Antiochus</hi> had laid so politick a ground of security from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he turns his face to the Maritime Towns and Isles, he assaulted some Sea-towns of <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> and took several Islands properly so called, as <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Samos, Delos</hi> and <hi>Eubea▪</hi> This was lookt upon as an
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49984:73"/>affront to the <hi>Roman</hi> Power. But <hi>Lucius Scipio</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Commander shall cause the reproach offered to him to cease and return it upon <hi>Antiochus.</hi> For at <hi>Sipylus,</hi> a Mountain in <hi>Asia minor,</hi> near the Confines of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> he slew fifty thousand of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his men, and took eleven thousand Prisoners, as <hi>Justin</hi> writes, and brought him to such hard and dishonourable terms of Peace, that he was bound to have nothing more to do with any part of <hi>Europe;</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> should have <hi>Asia,</hi> and he rest content with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Syria,</hi> that he should surrender all his Ships and Captives, and defray the expences of the War. See <hi>Justin,</hi> lib. 31. He gave Hostages also for performance of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to wit, his two Sons, <hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> Thus was the reproach cast upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Power by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> returned with usury upon himself at last.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 19. Upon this <hi>Antiochus</hi> marched towards the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of his own Kingdom to <hi>Apamia, Susa,</hi> and other more remote parts of his own Dominions. And his stumbling and falling refers to his rash and inconsiderate robbing the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Elymaeus</hi> by night, which being known by the <hi>Elymites,</hi> he and his whole army was slain by that people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 20. Then shall succeed in his place by right of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance <hi>Seleucus Philopator,</hi> the elder Son of <hi>Antiochus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who would not fail to be a raiser of Taxes, who was so eager on money, his luxury and necessity requiring it, that he did not stick to appoint <hi>Heliodorus</hi> his Treasurer, to rob the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> 2 Mac. 3.10. But for [In] it should rather be <hi>upon</hi> the <hi>glory of the Kingdom,</hi> that is, upon the Riches thereof. For Riches are the Political glory and decor of any Kingdom, whenas poverty makes them look sordidly and contemptibly. But he is said to be destroy'd in a few days, because he reigned but twelve years, when as his Father <hi>Antiochus</hi> reigned thirty seven. But he perished neither by the Insurrection of his own Subjects, nor by War with Foreigners, but was secretly poisoned by <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> who hoped to succeed him in his Kingdom.</p>

And though his beginnings were but small, yet by flatterings, frauds and crouchings he grew up by degrees as his Antitype did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 24. He will in a fair and peaceable manner, without any shew of enmity to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> possess himself of the best places of <hi>Syria,</hi> as his Antitype the Papal Hierarchy of the fairest and fattest seats in <hi>Europe.</hi> And he shall be a greater exactour of Tributes, and more profuse rewarder of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, his Souldiers especially, than any of his Ancestours,

                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 25. He shall move his forces against the King of <hi>Aegypt, Ptolemaeus Philometor,</hi> because he pretended a right to <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Ptolemaeus</hi> his two chief Commanders, <hi>Eulaius</hi> and <hi>Leneus</hi> shall bring out a mighty army against him, but they shall not be able to withstand <hi>Antiochus,</hi> because there will be treacherous plots against the Army of <hi>Philometor.</hi>

Some of <hi>Philometor</hi>'s Domesticks, Ministers of State, and of great trust in his affairs, and in this War, shall be false to him, and so spoil the success of the Battel.

                     <hi>V.</hi> 30. <hi>For the ships of Chittim.</hi> Chittim may signifie either the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Macedonians,</hi> but it being <hi>Zijim Chit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> and <hi>Zijim</hi> not being <hi>in Regimine,</hi> as they call it, but an Adjective that signifies <hi>rough, rude</hi> or <hi>harsh,</hi> it may be more naturally rendred. For the <hi>rough Romans</hi> shall come against him. And thus it fitly reflects on <hi>Popilius</hi> his rough handling <hi>Antiochus</hi> when he was besieging <hi>Alexandria.</hi> For <hi>Popilius</hi> was sent from the Senate to bid him desist, <hi>Aegypt</hi> having committed themselves to the <hi>Roman</hi> tutelage. And, when they met, <hi>Antiochus</hi> offering to kiss <hi>Popilius</hi> upon their former familiarity at <hi>Rome,</hi> he bluntly bad him for bear those ceremonies, and upon his producing the decree of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the other making delays, and pretending it fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult his friends. <hi>Popilius</hi> presently drawing a circle with his stick about <hi>Antiochus,</hi> bad him consult his friends upon the spot, nor pass out of the circle till he had declared whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would have War or Peace with the <hi>Romans.</hi> Which rough dealing, saith <hi>Justin, Adeò animum Regis fregit ut pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum se Senatui responderet,</hi> i. e. So broke the courage of the King, that he answered he would obey the Senate. <hi>Therefore he shall be grieved.</hi> The Seventy and Latine out of the Hebrew render it, And he shall be struck, broken or humbled, which suits better with that of <hi>Justin,</hi> but que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless he was <hi>grieved</hi> withall. <hi>Against the Holy Covenant.</hi> And he will ease his grief and discharge his rage on the Jews, those especially that adhere to the Holy law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. He shall have intelligence with them that forsake the Holy Covenant, Jason</hi> and <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and those of that faction, that for his disappointed hopes on <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he might carry what spoils he can from <hi>Judaea</hi> the City and Temple, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might seem not to return into <hi>Syria</hi> empty.</p>

So <hi>Gasper Sanctius.</hi> And <hi>Calvin</hi> speaks to the same purpose. Which answers to that <hi>chap.</hi> 8.24. And both to <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Antitype, who is not properly sustained by his own power, but by the power of the ten
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49984:75"/>Kings, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. <hi>Pollute the sanctuary of strength.</hi> They shall enter into the Temple, take away the silver, and the gold, and the precious vessels, and the hidden treasures, 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 1.23. And this is the first degree of Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>And shall take away the daily sacrifice.</hi> This is the next. That <hi>Antiochus</hi> will send letters by messengers unto <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> to command them to follow the laws of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and forbid burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and drink-offerings in the Temple, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 1.44. That they should not serve God according to his own Laws, but according to Paganick Rites prescribed by this type of Antichrist. <hi>The Abomination that maketh desolate.</hi> Of the placing this Idol upon the Altar, and the building Altar-Idols through the Cities of <hi>Judah</hi> on every side, and their tearing and burning the Law, which is the last and highest prophanation, see 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 1.54. This Idol is <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter Olympius</hi> as both <hi>Calvin, Cornelius à Lapide</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> acknowledge, whom therefore that old Sophist of <hi>Athens,</hi> 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 6.1. might the better persuade the Jews to be the true God of Heaven, whom they themselves worshipped. The Hebrew is <hi>Hasshakutz Meshomem,</hi> which signifies either a stupifying Idol, or an Idol that makes desolate. And an Idol may very well be said to <hi>stupisie,</hi> it making its worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers as arrand blocks as it self, and <hi>astonishing</hi> all sensible men, that mankind should ever become such blocks as to worship Idols. And to <hi>make desolate,</hi> as causing such vast murtherings of pious men, and frighting them from the publick worship, so that the Temple of God is left naked and desolate, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 4.37. But how excellently well the Antitype answers to the Type. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> on this verse in his <hi>Exposition.</hi>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 32. Those that against the Law had given money for the High-Priesthood, he would farther persuade by fair words to comply with his Idolatrous designs. But those that knew their God, not by dry imagination, but by faith that had a living root in their heart, which implies a purity there, from whence all firm assurance of knowledge in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine matters doth arise, these by the strength and power of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49984:76"/>God, and by faith in his Assistence will not be forced through the threats of mortal men, be they never so potent, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Law of God, and to relinquish their loyalty to him, who brings these persecutions on his people, on purpose to try them. For the fulfilling of this Prophecy, see <hi>Joseph.</hi> lib. 12. c. 7. and the books of <hi>Maccabees.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 33. Those that understand among the people are such as before were said to know their God from such a principle of life in their heart, not in dry imaginative opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who though they shall fall, that is, be afflicted and persecuted by the sword, flame, captivity and spoil of goods, though these things be in their eyes, and they be in a manner certain to undergo them, yet these, in whom the true knowledge of God is, will not desist from their duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 34. <hi>Mattathias</hi> with his five Sons (amongst whom was <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi>) he will open a way toward their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. See 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2.1. and 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 5. <hi>Cleave to them with flatteries.</hi> From the Hebrew, for <hi>flatteries,</hi> it may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>Lubricities</hi> or <hi>Slipperinesses.</hi> That many shall join themselves to them slipperily, not firmly or sincerely. There shall not be an intimate firm union from one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which is the hearty love of God, and unfeigned zeal for the purity of his worship, but they shall adhere from by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respects of ambition or covetousness, or the like. There are examples of such in the Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and I wish they were no types of some in the Reformation. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> on this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 35. Some of them that know their God in the sense above explained, shall fall into misery and affliction, so the Seventy render it according as the word is oft used in the New Testament, which agrees with what follows, to <hi>try them, purge them, and make them white.</hi> And therefore those troubles that seem so direfull and tragical to mortal men, proceed from the love of God to his own, that he may make them more pure, and consequently better fitted for communion with himself. Reade attentively what St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 2 Cor. 4.17. <hi>Even to the time of the end,</hi> that is, To the time of their ending. <hi>Because it is yet for a time
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49984:76"/>appointed.</hi> Reade out of the Hebrew, Because yet again at the time appointed, <hi>viz.</hi> under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire (whose succession begins in the next verse) there will be a new affliction or persecution of my People or Church.</p>
                  <p>But now that the times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire succeed in the next verse, both the mention of the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>times,</hi> and <hi>half a time,</hi> chap. 12.7. and those other two numbers there that point to them; and that vast gap that would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s time and the resurrection of the dead, mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 2. may sufficiently assure us. The transition also is as express as that from the <hi>Persian</hi> to the <hi>Greek</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, verse 3. and the like expression of prosperity, in both, of the King or Empire, they enter upon. <hi>And he shall do according to his will.</hi> See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his Notes on this place, or <hi>Pezelius</hi> his <hi>Mellificium</hi> at the end of Part 1. Which expression aforesaid can't be understood of <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> as you may understand thence. And Interpreters that would apply what follows to him, their applications are wretchedly distorted, and they are fain to make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy fondly to tautologize. But make the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire here to succeed the <hi>Greek</hi> as the <hi>Greek</hi> does the <hi>Persian,</hi> v. 3. and all will run easily and glibly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 36. The former verse ended with an intimation of new affliction to God's people or Church, and now this Prophecy goes on. <hi>And the King.</hi> Out of the Hebrew you may reade, <hi>For</hi> that <hi>eminent</hi> King or Kingdom, (for it is <hi>Hammeleck</hi> where the article <hi>He</hi> has the sense of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> which for extent and duration much surpasses any of the former three, <hi>Shall do according to his will,</hi> i. e. Shall be strangely prosperous, and much prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the mother of pride, cruelty and impiety. <hi>Above every God.</hi> This <hi>Roman</hi> King or Kingdom, even <hi>quatenus Pagan</hi> may be said to magnifie himself above every god, in that the <hi>Romans</hi> by sacred charms called out the gods of those Cities they conquered, and, so as it were, led them captive to <hi>Rome.</hi> See <hi>Synops. Prophet.</hi> Book 2. Chap. 10. <hi>Against the God of gods.</hi> The Officers of this <hi>Roman</hi> Power shall speak blasphemous things against <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> himself,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49984:77"/>who was truly God as well as man, and therefore the God of gods; yet was he in word and deed most despitefully used by them and crucify'd. The <hi>Romans</hi> also despised the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> even the better sort of them, as <hi>Cicero.</hi> See his Oration <hi>pro Flacco.</hi> And yet shall the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, though Pagan, stand and prosper, notwithstanding this their villany toward Christ and bloudy persecution of his members in the Primitive times, wherein he was again reproached, till the determinate time of this rage expired, and the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Christian.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 37. Here the Prophecy reaches into the times after the Empire was turned Christian. Whence it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that 'tis said, That he regards not the God of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Mars,</hi> suppose, the Tutelar God of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>women,</hi> importing that marriage then will not be in that high esteem it was with the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> as the Laws <hi>Julia</hi> and <hi>Papia</hi> testifie, which <hi>Constantine</hi> abrogated. Thus far from the foregoing verse to the fore-part of this, may the Prophecy presigure the state of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, without any reference to the <hi>Roman</hi> Antichristian Power. But the same part of the Prophecy is also applicable to the <hi>Antichristian</hi> Polity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and therefore takes in that too. Wherefore beginning at the 36th verse, we shall Paraphrase these two verses so far as they concern that <hi>Antichrist,</hi> which undoubtedly <hi>Paul</hi> aims at, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. thus: After the reign of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> that type of Antichrist, and notorious enemy of the people of God in the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, shall there arise an eminent King or Royal <hi>Pontifex</hi> if you will, who with his Ecclesiastick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity shall prove the very Antichrist indeed, answering in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to that wicked <hi>Antiochus</hi> in the Greek, and both of them placed in the latter times of each Empire. Which Ecclesiastical Prince or <hi>Pontifex</hi> finding the stream of affairs and good fortune to carry him along, shall at last exalt himself above every God, that is, every Supreme Magistrate, the Emperour himself not excepted, nay shall speak strange blasphemous words against the Sovereignty of God himself, as if he had power to abrogate or dispence
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49984:77"/>with the Laws of God and Christ, and were himself the <hi>Supremum numen in terris.</hi> In which impieties he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper for such a time as Providence shall permit, <hi>viz.</hi> till the latter end of the time, and times, and half a time.</p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding all this wickedness, he shall not be a mere <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan, nor shall he regard the gods of his Ancestours or Predecessours (that is, of the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates of <hi>Rome</hi> that reigned there before in old time) such gods as <hi>Neptune, Mars, Jupiter, Capitolinus,</hi> and the like. But this shall be notable in him, that he shall be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly a strict professour of a single life, nor shall it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with his Pontifical office to marry, nor permitted to his Hierarchy so to do, that he may the better thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the designs of his rampant ambition. Which spirit of pride and worldliness shall grow so rank in him, that he shall in time cast off the real sense of all Piety, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard any God, but shall magnifie himself above all, subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinating all Religion to his own worldly advantage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest. Whence it will be, that amongst other things he will make no conscience of Idolatry.</p>

And the Saint worshippers give such titles as these to them and their Relicks, viz. <hi>Towers, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses, Walls, Bulwarks, Guards</hi> and <hi>Protectours,</hi> which is the very thing that <hi>Mahu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>zim</hi> signifies. <hi>And a God whom his fathers,</hi> &amp;c. Reade according to the Hebrew, <hi>Even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a god,</hi> which his fathers (his Ancestours the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Romans</hi>) knew not (which God is Christ) shall he honour them with gold and silver, and precious stones and pleasant things. Which is abundantly fulfilled in the rich offerings to, and cloathings of the Images and Altars of the Saints in the Romish Church, which are very costly and sumptuous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 39. In the English Version the sense is obscure. The Hebrew runs thus and is easie. And he shall make the <hi>Holds</hi> of the <hi>Mahuzzim</hi> jointly to the foreign God, that is, he will build or erect Holds jointly appertaining to both the <hi>Mahuzzim</hi> and the foreign God. Which are Churches and Monasteries dedicated to Christ (he is that foreign God) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with this or that Saint. And elegantly are they here called <hi>Holds,</hi> in reference to <hi>Mahuzzim,</hi> which has a warlike sense in it, and signifies military Protectours and Champions, whose Houses therefore may well be termed strong Holds. And for this <hi>Foreign God,</hi> him he shall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and encrease with Glory, that is, even Antichrist shall make an outward profession of Christ, and accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late external pomps and shews in honour of him. <hi>And he shall cause them,</hi> viz. the <hi>Mahuzzim</hi> or departed Saints, to rule over many, and shall distribute the earth to them for a reward. So <hi>Vatablus</hi> out of the Hebrew. The Saints are made as it were <hi>Tutelar</hi> Deities of Kingdoms, Provinces, Cities and other places, as a reward of their sufferings, and for the good Offices they are supposed to do for them that worship them and pray to them. Which is a lively description of the condition of the Papacy at
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49984:78"/>this very day; And indeed of a long time heretofore, both of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church, of both which the Pope pretends to be the supreme Patriarch. For which the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Empire has been sorely scourged by the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> namely, for worshipping the <hi>Mahuzzim,</hi> that is, <hi>Demons</hi> or the Souls of deceased Saints, and in order to them images of Gold and of Silver, and of Brass and of Stone, <hi>&amp;c. Apoc.</hi> 9.20. The plagues of the <hi>Locusts</hi> and <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horsemen, that is, of the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> came upon them for this. And so it follows answerably here upon the mention of these <hi>Mahuzzim,</hi> in the next verse.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 40. <hi>At the time of the end,</hi> i. e. within the compass of the time and times and half a time under the fifth trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet shall the <hi>Locusts</hi> or <hi>Saracens</hi> come against the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Empire, whose original is from <hi>Arabia,</hi> which lyeth south of the said Empire. <hi>And the King of the North,</hi> that is, The <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horsemen, which are the <hi>Turks,</hi> and whose original is northren beyond the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, at a great distance opposite to <hi>Arabia,</hi> these under the sixth trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, which is the last part of the time and times, and half a time, shall invade the same <hi>Roman</hi> Empire by reason of that idolatrous Antichristian Polity there, like a whirlwind or strong tempest from the North. <hi>And with many ships,</hi> ships are here mentioned consentaneously to what follows, that he shall overslow and pass over by Sea out of <hi>Asia Minor</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> and at last take <hi>Constantinople</hi> and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruine the Eastern part of the Empire for their Idolatries, with the <hi>Mahuzzim,</hi> as has been above intimated.</p>

The King of the North, the <hi>Turk</hi> will be Master of this land too, as he is known to be, at this day. But <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> and the chief of the children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> that is, saith Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Arabia Petraea</hi> were never yet Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire, yea with some of them he is fain to be at pension for the safer passage of his Caravans.</p>

Which shews some grand mutation of Affairs and jeopardy, that the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire in those Eastern parts will seem to be in at that time. But the tidings out of the North may be of a most formidable strength of <hi>Tartars</hi> invading the <hi>Turkish</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, at the same time it may be converted to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion. <hi>To make away many,</hi> To make away any by whose overthrow he may hope to strengthen himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those imminent dangers he is so sensible of, or may compensate his losses.</p>

But that there is little likelihood that <hi>Judaea</hi> is here meant, and the Hills on which the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was built, may appear from hence, that <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in truth is neither placed betwixt two Seas, nor <hi>Judaea</hi> any new Aequist of the <hi>Turk</hi> here, he having entred and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed it before <hi>v.</hi> 41. But <hi>Rome</hi> is betwixt two Seas, the <hi>Mare Adriaticum,</hi> and <hi>Mare Tyrrhenum,</hi> nor was he ever yet Master of it; and it is very famous for its Hills or Mountains. Which City being the Metropolis of <hi>Holy</hi> Church, or the <hi>Papal Hierarchy,</hi> and the Seat of his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> so called, it is no wonder that <hi>Kodesh,</hi> which signifies Holiness is here added. And moreover though <hi>Sabi</hi> were a proper note of <hi>Judaea</hi> and the Temple there, yet as it is said of the Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> though but a Type of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, <hi>Ezek</hi> 28. That he was the <hi>anointed Cherub,</hi> and set upon the Holy Mountain of God, walkt in the midst of the stones of fire, that is, the sparkling stones in <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Breast-plate, why may not <hi>Har-Sabi,</hi> the Mountain of Glory be referred to Antichrist himself, though it properly belong to the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> especially <hi>Sabi</hi> in the appellative sense, denoting as well an <hi>empty tumid</hi> Glory, as a <hi>solid?</hi> And though <hi>Sabi</hi> were taken in the sense of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Sebaoth,</hi> is not Antichrist that <hi>King of Pride</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over an <hi>Army</hi> of Priests, and do they not give the Titles of <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Omnipotency</hi> to the Pope? So that mount <hi>Coelius</hi> will be <hi>Har Sabi</hi> the Mountain of <hi>Sabi,</hi> whose Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is the Holiness of <hi>Rome,</hi> as if <hi>Kodesh</hi> were added for a certain Character of the party. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> and <hi>Notes</hi> on the place. And the <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>S. E.</hi> his <hi>remarks. Yet shall he come to his end, and none shall help him.</hi> The easie and natural Version of this passage out of the Hebrew is this. And he shall come to the top of it (<hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Hill,</hi> suppose mount <hi>Coelius</hi>) and no man shall help <hi>it,</hi> namely, the <hi>Hill</hi> and rescue it out of his hands. This version has the Countenance of the <hi>Seventy,</hi> of the <hi>vulgar Latin;</hi> of <hi>Vatablus, Gasper Sanctius,</hi> and <hi>Maldonat.</hi> Which implys that the King of the North will make himself per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Master of this Hill or Hills and City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49984:80"/>no man will hinder him by rescuing the Hill, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the City and seat of the Pope out of his hand. And thus this Prophecy describing so lively the Idolatrous state of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, and the beginnings of his punishment under the fifth and sixth Trumpets, does glance also at his final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction under the <hi>seventh,</hi> as the Visions of the Metalline Image and the four Beasts do. And therefore there is all reason that this Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth</hi> should do so too. But as it is said in the beginning thereof, <hi>It is for a long time;</hi> so if the 2300 <hi>Evening-mornings</hi> have a typical sense, it will be those three or four hundred years till the accomplishing this part of the Prophecy. Besides, that all Comminatory Prophecies take effect according as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves that are concerned. See Dr. <hi>H.

This passage therefore denotes the time when the affairs of the Jews become very hopefull and prosperous, which is about the sixth and seventh Vials, to speak in the language of the Apocalypse. <hi>As never was since,</hi> &amp;c. see <hi>Apoc.</hi> 16.18. The comparing of which place with the present, plainly shews that this time of trouble belongs to the seventh Vial. <hi>Shall be delivered.</hi> The <hi>Seventy</hi> and the <hi>vulgar Latine</hi> have it, Shall be <hi>saved,</hi> viz. from that abject condition they lived in among the Nations, from the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly elements of <hi>Moses,</hi> and by their faith in Christ shall be made partakers of <hi>eternal salvation,</hi> and not the Jews onely, but every one, as well Gentiles as Jews, that are found written in the <hi>Book of life,</hi> mentioned <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.12.</p>

See <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. <hi>And some to shame,</hi> &amp;c. Out of the Hebrew reade, But <hi>those others,</hi> another sort of people which the Prophecy points at, whose condition commences with the first Resurrection, <hi>These</hi> shall be in perpetual shame and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49984:81"/>contempt all along the time of the blessed <hi>Millennium.</hi> These are those Dogs, Sorcerers, Whoremongers, Murtherers, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters and Lyars that are excluded the holy City.</p>
                  <p>But now if [many] be not taken for a certain number in counterdistinction to [all] but for the <hi>generality</hi> or a vast multitude, as Criticks allow [many] sometimes so to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, then the text may be expounded of the <hi>General</hi> Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and then [some to everlasting life] and [some to shame and everlasting contempt] will be a fit distribution of those many, or all that are then said to arise out of the dust of the earth.</p>

But they that are not onely wise and holy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but are instrumental in the promoting true wisedom and holiness in others, shall shine as the Stars, shall have a greater and more peculiar eminent glory than others. Which is easily applicable either to the godly Pastours and Magistrates in the <hi>Millennium,</hi> or to the different degrees of the glorified Bodies of the Saints at the Resurrection. And thus we see this Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth</hi> to reach to the general Resurrection. And that the time, as was intimated in the beginning, is long indeed.

This command to <hi>Daniel</hi> to seal the Book to the time of the end, intimates that these Visions of the Book will not be unsealed till then, till the <hi>last</hi> times or times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, but that then men will be inquisitive and hunt after truth, and not altogether in vain, but will, several I mean, understand the <hi>coming of Christ</hi> by the help of the Prophecies of this Book, and in the latter part of these last times the <hi>coming</hi> also of <hi>Antichrist</hi> (which is chiefly here aimed at) when knowledge shall most of all abound, as it has very much, this last age or two.</p>

To him is made the question. How long shall those won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull things that have been here foretold continue? This question touching the continuation of these wonders doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less respects that part of the Prophecy that begins at verse 36. and ends with the Resurrection.

For the last Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet reaches to the general Resurrection, after which there shall be no more time.

But whom the fear of God has made truly wise, these will prove competent judges of the right sense of these Prophecies, and will not be such fools as to expect much light from the Ancient Fathers for the understanding of them; Forasmuch as it is expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that they are closed up and sealed till the latter times, or those times which the two following numbers point to.</p>

Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical days or years. At the end of this number, reckoning from the time of the Prophanation of the Temple under <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> which will reach into the year of Christ 1120, will this King of Pride or Antichrist be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, as it came to pass in a marvellous manner by a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and judicious Book, writ by the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and published that year.

            <div type="preface">
               <head>The PREFACE.</head>
               <p>BEcause it is accustomary with them that write Notes on any Book of the Bible, to say something by way of Preface; this Book al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, as much as any, requiring the same, I shall briefly premise something touching the <hi>Authour</hi> who it was that wrote it, and <hi>what time</hi> it was written, what the <hi>main parts</hi> of the Book be, what the <hi>assurance</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,</hi> and what the <hi>scope</hi> and use of the Book is, and shall add an Explication of <hi>two usefull Schemes</hi> for the more easie understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb facs="tcp:49984:84"/>and retaining in memory the Synchroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick order of the Visions of the Apocalypse, and the ground of distinguishing the Times of the Church into <hi>Symmetral</hi> and <hi>Asymmetral,</hi> with the meaning of those Terms.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Now as for the <hi>Authour</hi> of this Book, the Apocalypse, it is generally agreed on all hands, that it was <hi>John the Divine,</hi> who was also the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> who bare witness of the Word of God, and of the things that himself had seen: who was also banished into <hi>Patmos,</hi> which no Church-History testifies of either <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus</hi> or of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Divine:</hi> who having had the keeping of the Book committed to him by his Master as a secret, it not being fit to be in the hands of many as having such things in it as might well raise jealousies in the <hi>Roman</hi> State against the Christians, and yet coming out at last cut of his hands, might give occasion to some to think him the Authour of it, as <hi>Grotius</hi> inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously conjectures. Besides, it being so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious a Book of Divine Secrets, to whom should Christ impart them but to his bosome-friend and disciple his beloved <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist</hi> (called the <hi>Divine</hi> more specially for his
<pb facs="tcp:49984:84"/>so openly and expresly declaring the Divinity of our Saviour) and not to an ordinary Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, much less to a wretched Heretick as <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus</hi> was. The more than humane artifice in the frame of the Book and Divine Predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein may assure us that so poor a wight as <hi>Cerinthus</hi> was no Authour thereof: And I have met with no Objections against <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangelist</hi>'s being the Authour of it, but such as are so weak and mean that they are not worth the noting. And if this Book had not, which yet it has, the Testimony of both the Greek and Latine <hi>Fathers,</hi> and of <hi>Councils</hi> to authentize it, yet it would prove it self to be a Book divinely inspired from the continual Truths of the Predictions therein, applied to History, as I hope the present Illustration will make good.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> And now for <hi>the time</hi> when it was <hi>writ,</hi> it is the common opinion of the Fathers, and of Church-Historians, as you may at large see both in <hi>Ribera</hi> and <hi>Alcazar,</hi> that it was writ in the latter end of the reign of <hi>Domitian,</hi> in the year of Christ <hi>94.</hi> The strength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the Authority of Antiquity, does so forcibly tye <hi>Alcazar</hi> to this truth, that, although
<pb facs="tcp:49984:85"/>he expounds all the first six Seals and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets of things above twenty years past, before <hi>John</hi> received these Visions, yet he is so far from abandoning this current opinion of the Ancients, that he earnestly defends it, and fully acquiesceth in it. But <hi>Grotius</hi> aware of the gross absurdity in making so many Visions of a Book of <hi>Prophecies,</hi> as the Apocalypse is sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to represent onely things <hi>past,</hi> endeavours to draw back the time of <hi>John</hi>'s receiving these Visions to the reign of <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian.</hi> But what wretched work he makes of it, you may be fully satisfied by reading the second Chapter of the second Book of <hi>Synop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis Prophetica,</hi> and clearly see that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no scruple, but that the Apocalypse was imparted to <hi>John</hi> near the end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s reign. Which sweeps away at once all the vain conceits of <hi>Grotius</hi> his way of interpreting the Apocalypse, and of as many as tread in his steps.</p>

                  <hi>3.</hi> As for the <hi>main parts</hi> of the Book, they are three, or indeed three main Prophecies. <hi>1.</hi> The <hi>Epistolar Prophecy,</hi> or the seven E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles to the seven Churches, setting out the State of the true Apostolick Church, according
<pb facs="tcp:49984:85"/>to seven successive Intervals of time, from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World. <hi>2.</hi> The <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains more especially the affairs of the Empire, whose time, from the same <hi>Epocha,</hi> divided first into seven Seals, then the seventh Seal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to seven Trumpets, and then the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet into seven Thunders reacheth to the same Term with the former, even to the last Thunder and Conflagration. <hi>3.</hi> The <hi>Opened-book-prophecy,</hi> which more peculiarly respects the affairs of the Church, and is Synchronal to the two former Prophecies. But then besides these <hi>Prophecies</hi> themselves, there are so many <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory</hi> Visions prefixt one to each of the three, and that not onely for Dramatical pomp, but for usefull Truth and Instruction. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory</hi> Vision to the first Prophecy is the Appearance of Christ, <hi>chap. 1.</hi> amidst the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven golden Candlesticks, ushered in with a great voice as of a Trumpet speaking, which <hi>John</hi> heard behind him, and so turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, saw the sight. Several parts of which Representation are made use of for a Title of Christ in the beginning of each Epistle. And in that Christ dictates these Epistles to <hi>John,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49984:86"/>this respects that truth, <hi>v. 1.</hi> That the things shortly to come to pass, Christ by an Angel sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified them to his servant <hi>John.</hi> Whence it is no wonder that <hi>John</hi> makes mention of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so often, as being he to whom Christ had granted this privilege. But moreover this voice like a Trumpet speaking to <hi>John,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this Vision of Christ being the <hi>Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi> to this first <hi>main</hi> Prophecy, it is a fair Indication, that where the like voice and pompous appearance occurs again, it is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction</hi> to a like <hi>main</hi> Prophecy, and of equal extent. And such an <hi>Introductory</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion there is before the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy,</hi> chap. <hi>4.</hi> and <hi>5.</hi> And the first voice as of a Trumpet is heard again by <hi>John,</hi> chap. <hi>4.1.</hi> And a pompous Scene there is, God the Father sitting on a Throne with twenty four Elders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him and the four Beasts; having a Book with seven Seals in his hand, and none found worthy but the Lamb Christ to take the Book and open the Seals, which is a more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent expression of what is but briesly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, <hi>chap. 1.1.</hi> The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which <hi>God gave to him,</hi> of which
<pb facs="tcp:49984:86"/>gift from the Father <hi>John</hi> is here a witness, as also of his opening the Seals, and so Christ signifies what he received of his Father, unto <hi>John</hi> again, as was noted before. And as the parts of the <hi>Introductory</hi> Vision were made use of in that Epistolar Prophecy it self; so here again, some parts of this Introductory Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are made use of in this Prophecy, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Lamb</hi> as Opener of the Seals, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Invitation of the <hi>four Beasts</hi> to come and see as the Lamb opened the four first Seals. Which was a very usefull artifice in this Vision and Prophecy, the Church being able by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from what quarter the Emperour came to note the veracity of this Divine Book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, finding the Empire in such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances as were presigured, and counting the approach thence of the sixth Seal, which was to bring in the overthrow of the red Dragon and the Churches deliverance. But in the mean time here is a sufficient Indication in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory Vision, that it brings in a Prophecy of as extensive a concern as the former, and Synchronal thereto. And there being the like <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory</hi> Vision, though also <hi>transitionary,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49984:87"/>chap. <hi>10.</hi> where <hi>Christ</hi> appears not in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a <hi>Lamb,</hi> but of a glorious Angel roaring like a <hi>Lion,</hi> and with an opened-book in his hand, the same which his Father had given him sealed, and the voice which <hi>John</hi> had heard before (doubtless as of a Trumpet) bids him take the Book of the Angel, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel gives him, and commands him to eat it, and when he had so done, tells him he must Prophesie again before many peoples and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What can all this denote, but that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon this begins a third <hi>main</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of equal extent with the former commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with the Church, and terminating in the end of the World? which Prophecy is called the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy,</hi> and which Christ here by giving him the Book to eat, is plainly understood to impart to his servant <hi>John</hi> things to come to pass, as is briefly intimated, <hi>chap. 1.1.</hi> So that these three <hi>Introductory</hi> Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though they be no parts of the three main Prophecies, yet we see they have their use, and are not set down for mere Dramatical Pomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake. And the same may be said of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted <hi>Doxologies,</hi> chap. <hi>11.</hi> v. <hi>15, 16, 17.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49984:87"/>and chap. <hi>15.</hi> v. <hi>3, 4, 5.</hi> and elsewhere, that they are not mere Musical <hi>Interludes,</hi> as in a Comedy. For these are shrewd directions to the sagacious how to order the Visions as to Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronism; but it would be over-long to insist on these things in this short Preface.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4.</hi> Now for the <hi>assurance</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Interpretation,</hi> it consists, <hi>1.</hi> In a right and unexceptionable digestion of the Visions into a true Series and Succession of time, and making out truly what Visions either wholly or partially synchronize one with another. <hi>2.</hi> In a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the signification of Prophetick Iconisms or Symbols, and the nature of the Prophetick style. <hi>3.</hi> That nothing be strained or forced against the Laws of Grammar or warrantable Criticism. <hi>4.</hi> As to those Visions that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what is past (For this due Series of the Visions being made out and their Synchronisms, those Histories, without roving, are to be sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched that belong to that part of the Series of the Visions and the Synchronals thereto) if History afford such things as easily and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agree to the said Visions, and are of weight and importance (for the Spirit of Prophecy does not trifle) there is as great assurance of the
<pb facs="tcp:49984:88"/>truth of the Interpretation of such Visions as there can be of any other parts of Scripture whatever, and such as no man unprejudiced can doubt of. For the Prophetick style and Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisms are as determinately intelligible as any other Language. <hi>5.</hi> And lastly, we being thus assured of the true Interpretation of those Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are past, or so far as they are past, the Visions that concern what is to come, if they respect the same parties, their Interpretation, though not so punctually and particularly, yet for the main may be certainly true; and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though more conjectural, yet it sufficeth that it be rational.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5.</hi> As for the <hi>scope</hi> and <hi>use</hi> of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse, besides, what is common to all Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that it is a notable demonstration of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, and existence of Invisible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Powers, and so a fit Antidote against Atheism and Saducism, it is a seriously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Representation of the State of the Church from the beginning of Christianity to the end of the World; and whatever other things are complicated therewith, yet it is in order to the use and instruction of the true Church, that they may know in what times they are, and how
<pb facs="tcp:49984:88"/>they are to behave themselves successively in them all, what to endure under Paganism and Paganochristianism, and what to expect; what to amend in the <hi>Sardian</hi> and <hi>Laodicean</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, and what the best method of continuing the <hi>Philadelphian.</hi> And forasmuch as all men in a manner have complained of a strange general degeneracy in the Church into a Pagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Idolatry and Cruelty, and that it cannot be denied but the Apocalypse is a Book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, reaching from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World, how perverse and stupid must those Souls be, that can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that in such a Book of Prophecies as this, a thing of such mighty importance should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and so foul and gross degeneracy of the Church, as has been observed, and cried out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst by such as never pretended to understand the Apocalypse, should not have been foreseen and foretold by the Spirit of Prophecy therein? Wherefore several of the Visions so sitly and naturally setting out this foul degeneracy, and agreeing with the time from assured Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, it is evident that one main Scope of the Apocalypse is the discovery of this <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> in the Church, that the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>We shall begin with the <hi>Antemedial</hi> Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where <hi>AEB</hi> is the Woman in travail, cloathed with the Sun, and crowned with twelve Stars, <hi>Apoc.</hi> chap. <hi>12.1.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Medial</hi> Visions now follow; where <hi>B C</hi> is the company of the <hi>144000</hi> Servants of God, sealed with the Seal of the living God in

As for the three Angels, <hi>chap. 14. v. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</hi> The first may be referred
<pb facs="tcp:49984:92"/>to the fifth and sixth Trumpets, the second to the close of the sixth Trumpet, and the third to the fourth Vial, and therefore belongs not to the Medial-Visions. But indeed the taking notice of these Angels in a Synchronistick Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is not so proper.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>Postmedial</hi>-Visions, we are to note, that <hi>CAH, HYP, PZQ, QqR, RrS, SpT, ToD,</hi> are the seven Anti-syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronals to the seven Thunders, each synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing with its opposite in the Table. <hi>CAH</hi> is the Interval of the seven Vials, <hi>chap. 16.

               <p>Now for the other Scheme whereby thou mayst understand the grounds of distinguishing the times of the Church into <hi>Symmetral</hi> and <hi>Asymmetral,</hi> it is this. In this Ichnography of the Temple you are to note that αβ is the Temple it self, properly so called, α the <hi>Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
<pb facs="tcp:49984:94"/>Sanctorum</hi> or Holy of Holies, and β the <hi>Sanctum</hi> or Holy; γδ the Altar of Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>causts, <hi>A</hi>γ <hi>A</hi>δ the <hi>Thysiasterium</hi> or <hi>Alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> the place where the Altar stands. <hi>AAAA</hi> the Inner-Court. Which whole space the Inner-Court of the Temple being measured by the Reed the Angel gave to <hi>John,</hi> chap. <hi>11.</hi> is called <hi>commensurate</hi> or <hi>symmetral,</hi> and denotes the Primitive State of the Church, wherein she had not yet degenerated into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Rites and Ʋsages, and therefore in that regard is approved by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>But the other Space <hi>BBBBBBB,</hi> which is the Outer-Court, is represented as rejecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and prophane, in these words, <hi>v. 2.</hi> But the Outer-Court of the Temple leave out and measure it not as being to be troden down by the Gentiles, and to be defiled with a new kind of Gentilism and Idolatry, contrary to the Word of God, which is the true measure of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Rites and Ʋsages; with which these times not squaring, they are called <hi>Incommensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> or <hi>Asymmetral,</hi> as the former before the Apostasie into this Gentilism and Pagano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Idolatry are termed <hi>Symmetral.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49984:94"/>And this is the ground and occasion of those Terms of the <hi>Symmetral</hi> and <hi>Asymmetral</hi> Times or State of the Church. This is all that I thought requisite by way of Preface to instruct thee in for thy more easie and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory reading this Book of Divine Visions, and the <hi>Notes</hi> annexed for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of them.</p>

               <p n="10">10 I was in the Spirit on the Lords day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</p>

               <p n="12">12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;</p>
               <p n="13">13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks, one like unto the Son of man, cloathed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</p>
               <p n="14">14 His head and his hairs were white like wooll, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>THE Revelation of Jesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. namely, of things to come to pass, or future. Wherefore things already come to pass, such as are known already to be, and were plainly predicted before by Christ, to set out these under prophetick Aenigms or Symbols is no <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but an <hi>obscuring</hi> of what is known. Besides the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd contradiction of <hi>Prophesying</hi> in no less than two whole sets of Visions, the first six Seals, and the first six Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets of <hi>things past,</hi> at the time <hi>John</hi> received this Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> in the reign of <hi>Domitian.</hi> Which shews the vanity of <hi>Grotius</hi> his interpreting the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and of as many as follow him, who six the scene of all those Visions in <hi>Judaea,</hi> and end them with the sacking of the City which was before <hi>John</hi> wrote the <hi>Apocalypse. Which God gave unto him.</hi> Which is particularly intimated, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.7. And that all the <hi>three main</hi> Prophecies are the Revelation of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> is most magnificently represented in the three introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Visions. For the <hi>Epistolar prophecy.</hi> He that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears amidst the seven golden Candlesticks does dictate it, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.1. and <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 9. The Lamb onely is found worthy to take the book and open the Seals, whereby he is signified to be Authour of the <hi>Sealed-book Prophecy.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. The mighty Angel Christ gives to <hi>John</hi> the little open Book, the third main Prophecy, <hi>viz.</hi> the Opened-book Prophecy. <hi>Which must shortly come to pass.</hi> Some sooner, some later, but all of them shortly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of some Successions of Ages, in the Church or other, that they may be advertized of their concerns and stand upon their guard. <hi>Signified it by his Angel.</hi> By whose Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry these things through prophetick Visions, and Prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations wrought and impressed upon his inward man, were conveyed to <hi>John.</hi>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>Who bare record of the word of God.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Divine,</hi> so usually called for his express Testimony of the Divinity of Christ: and the <hi>Evangelist</hi> for writing his Acts and Miracles.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>Blessed is he that readeth,</hi> &amp;c. Blessed is he that observes the things written in this Book of Prophecies, that he may order his life accordingly, and always approve himself such as he is by these Visions admonished to be, and adhere to Christ sincerely, and to his true Church in all conditions. <hi>For the time is at hand,</hi> namely, for the fulfilling of such Visions as appertain to the earlier scene of the affairs of the Church, and will ever be at hand to the end of the world, for the fulfilling of some Visions of this Book or other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>John to the seven Churches which are in Asia.</hi> A direction of this whole Book of prophetick Visions, as of one entire Epistle to the truly Catholick and Apostolick Church distinguished into seven Successions; said to be in <hi>Asia</hi> by a Paronomastical allusion, to what <hi>Asia</hi> signifies in Hebrew, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Fundamentum</hi> which implies the truly Catholick and Apostolick Church, admitting nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the fundamentals of Christian Religion. 2. <hi>Mundum Asiathicum</hi> as the <hi>Cabbalists</hi> call it, of which this earth is the lowest part, which therefore intimates the Catholickness of these Churches, and that they are not confined to <hi>Asia</hi> in the literal sense. 3. There is also a third meaning of <hi>Asia,</hi> as it signifies <hi>Action,</hi> which is more seasonable to take notice of, when we come to the <hi>Episto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prophecy</hi> properly so called. <hi>Grace and Peace.</hi> All fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, happiness and prosperity. <hi>From him which is,</hi> &amp;c. From the eternal <hi>Jehovah</hi> who graspeth all, past present and to come, in the eternity of his Wisedom and Power, a privilege common to the whole Trinity. <hi>And from the seven Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. And from all his holy Angels (for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the <hi>Cabbalists</hi> signifies Universality) that assist his Throne, and that Minister sent from thence for the good of his people.</p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:49984:98"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>From Jesus Christ,</hi> that faithfull witness of the Will of his Father when he was upon earth, and the <hi>first begotten of the dead,</hi> the first fruits of them that slept, to whom is given the right of all the Kingdoms of the earth, to be Prince over them all, and to rule them in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Peace. <hi>To him that,</hi> &amp;c. That so loved us, that he laid his life down for us for a Propitiation for our sins, and to wash us from all the filth thereof through sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere repentance and mortification of our lusts, out of a due and gratefull return of love to him that dyed for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. <hi>And hath made us Kings and Priests,</hi> &amp;c. To offer spiritual Sacrifices of prayer and thanksgiving to God upon the Victories over our own lusts, whereby may be introduced a true reign of righteousness upon earth. And this will be the real establishment of the Kingdom of God the Father, to whom be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>Behold he cometh in the Clouds,</hi> (so vast a prospect have the Prophecies of this Book) and he will judge the whole World at the last day. And all shall see him, even they that pierced him and persecuted him in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or members of his true Church which is his Body, and all sorts of men shall wait because of him, who have thus outragiously sinned against him. <hi>Even so Amen.</hi> This is a certain truth, let Scoffers and Unbelievers say, and imagine what they please.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega,</hi> &amp;c. That it may not seem strange, that his providence and power reacheth so far as to the very last, from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World, he declares he is the Almighty grasping all things, in the hand of his all-comprehending Divinity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. <hi>In the isle that is called Patmos.</hi> One of the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clades</hi> so called in the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea. <hi>For the word of God,</hi> &amp;c. Thither banished for the preaching of the word of God, and bearing witness to the truth of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus.</p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:49984:98"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>I was in the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. That is to say, actuated and impressed upon in my inward man, my mind being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant from my earthly Body and external Senses, and wholly seized by the Divine and Angelical power, which caused in it the following Visions and prophetical Impressions, but as lively and clear as any Objects to the outward or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Senses. And when I was thus in the Spirit, and had as it were left the Body in this ecstasie, <hi>I heard behind me a great voice as of a Trumpet.</hi> Here begins the introductory Vision to the first of the three main Prophecies that fill this Book, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Epistolar Prophecy,</hi> properly so called. For he whose voice he heard, after dictates the Epistles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last,</hi> and shall declare unto thee such things as concern the Church continuedly, from the first beginning thereof to the end of the World. <hi>What thou seest write in a Book.</hi> This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition thus set before all the Apocalyptick Visions need not be consined to this <hi>Epistolar Prophecy,</hi> but be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for all the Prophecies of this Book. And thus all will be directed to the seven Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> that is, to the truly Catholick and Apostolick Church distinguished into seven Successions, <hi>Ephesine, Smyrnean, Pergamenian, Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirian, Sardian, Philadelphian, Laodicean;</hi> Which seven Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions one after another fill up the whole time of the Church universal, from the beginning thereof to the end of the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>To see the voice that spake with me,</hi> To see who it was that spake thus to me, And turning my self, I saw seven golden Candlesticks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. <hi>One like unto the Son of man.</hi> The representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion namely of Christ, as he is also one with his Church. For we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.30. They two shall be one flesh. This is a great Mystery, saith the Apostle, but I speak of Christ and his Church. <hi>Cloathed with a Garment down to the foot,</hi> &amp;c. In token that he is our High Priest, this habit alluding to the High Priests vestments.</p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:49984:99"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. His hairs white like wooll and Snow, set out the venerableness of this High Priest's person, and signifie he is that Christ which the Prophet calls <hi>Councellour</hi> the mighty God, the <hi>everlasting Father.</hi> For these are Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols of his Wisedom, and paternal Authority. His <hi>Eyes</hi> like a <hi>Flame of fire,</hi> denote the penetrancy of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Spirit, of discerning both in himself and in his Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. His <hi>feet</hi> like <hi>fine brass burning in a furnace,</hi> shew the stability and purity of his ways in himself, and the constancy of his Church in the Furnace of Affliction and fiery Tryals. And his voice as the sound of many waters; plainly discovers that Christ is here represented in union with his Church; waters signifying a multitude in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick style, as most certainly they doe. See the answer to <hi>S. E.</hi> his remarks on this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. The <hi>seven Stars</hi> in his right hand, according to his own interpretation, are the <hi>seven Angels</hi> of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Successions of the Church, whom he bears up, sustains and strengthens throughout all ages. And the <hi>sharp two edged Sword</hi> out of his mouth, is a Symbol of Christ as he is the living God quick and powerfull and sharper than any two edged Sword. And denotes also the powerfull word of the Gospel, preached by the living members of his Church. And his countenance as the <hi>Sun,</hi> betokens his being the Sun of righteousness, or relates to that which he is in the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> state where there is no need of <hi>Candle</hi> nor <hi>Sun,</hi> because this Sun of righteousness gives them light by the influence of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. John <hi>falls</hi> at <hi>his Feet as dead,</hi> as being exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly afraid, forasmuch as this sight (the Sword espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially and feet burning in a Furnace) might portend some great evil to the people of God. Which Christ's saying to him, <hi>Fear not, I am the first and the last,</hi> seems also to imply, he thereby intimating, That nothing shall come to pass without his Providence, and that he is able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them through all persecutions and deaths, and make them at last more than Conquerours.</p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:49984:99"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 18. As if he should say, For now I am alive, though I was my self dead once, but behold I am alive for evermore Amen, this is most certainly true of him whom this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion represents, and that he has the Keys of Hell and death. And therefore no man need fear to undergo Martyrdom for his cause, who will certainly make him partaker of a blessed Immortality, and plunge his barbarous Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors into everlasting perdition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 19. <hi>Write the things which thou hast seen,</hi> &amp;c. That is, the things which thou <hi>hast seen</hi> and <hi>known already,</hi> as being past, and the things that <hi>are present,</hi> and the things that <hi>are to come after,</hi> viz. The affairs of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession then past, of the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> then present, when <hi>John</hi> wrote these Visions, and of the rest of the Successions of the Church, which are to come afterwards. Which make up seven, and are the seven golden Candlesticks in the next verse, in the <hi>Accusative</hi> Case in the Greek, which the Verb [write] governs in this verse; or rather they are in the Accusative Case by Apposition. Which plainly shews that, [The things which thou hast seen] must be understood of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Succession. As if it were thus immediately. Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that shall be hereafter, <hi>viz.</hi> the seven golden Candlesticks, whereof the first is past, the second present, and the five other to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 20. <hi>The seven Stars are the Angels of the seven Churches,</hi> that is, The seven Successions of Bishops and Pastours, that are to shine forth in brightness and purity of their Life and Doctrine, in the seven Successions of the Churches. As the seven Candlesticks, (the seven Successions of the Apostolick Church) are here called seven Churches.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>ARG. <hi>Part of the first of the three main Prophecies, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the</hi> Epistolar Prophecy <hi>properly so called, to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches in</hi> Asia, <hi>containing the four first Epistles thereof, writ to the Church in</hi> Ephesus, <hi>in</hi> Smyrna, <hi>in</hi> Pergamus, <hi>and in</hi> Thyatira, <hi>and thereby describing the state of the truly Catholick and Apostolick Church, in those four first Successions or intervals thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>UNTO the angel of the church of Ephesus, write, These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks:</p>
               <p n="2">2 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not; and hast found them liars:</p>
               <p n="3">3 And hast born, and hast patience, and for my names sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast left thy first love.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</p>
               <p n="6">6 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</p>
               <p n="7">7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49984:100"/>cometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna, write, These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</p>
               <p n="9">9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation ten days: be thou faithfull unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</p>
               <p n="11">11 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh, shall not be hurt of the second death.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos, write, These things saith he, who hath the sharp sword with two edges:</p>
               <p n="13">13 I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satans seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithfull martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</p>
               <p n="14">14 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.</p>
               <p n="15">15 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:49984:101"/>
               <p n="16">16 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will sight against them with the sword of my mouth.</p>
               <p n="17">17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches, To him that overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it.</p>
               <p n="18">18 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira, write, These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a slame of sire, and his feet are like sine brass:</p>
               <p n="19">19 I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Notwithstanding, I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth her self a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And I gave her space to repent of her forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and she repented not.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except they repent of their deeds.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</p>
               <p n="24">24 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will put upon you none other burden.</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:49984:101"/>
               <p n="25">25 But that which ye have already, hold fast till I come.</p>
               <p n="26">26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</p>
               <p n="27">27 (And he shall rule them with a rod of iron: as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers) even as I received of my Father.</p>
               <p n="28">28 And I will give him the morning star.</p>

                  <head>The NOTES.</head>
                  <p>AFter the introductory Vision to the <hi>Epistolar Prophecy</hi> in the foregoing Chapter, we are come now to the Prophecy it self. And that these seven Epistles are such a Prophecy as has been asserted, if any one doubt let him read Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his twenty Arguments at the end of his <hi>Exposition of</hi> Daniel<hi>'s Visions,</hi> with his Notes on those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and he may receive full satisfaction. And how little harsh it is, that the first Epistle is wrote to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesine</hi> Church then past, you may understand from what the same Authour has writ in his <hi>Exposition of the seven Epistles to the seven Churches,</hi> chap. 1. sect. 4, 5. or out of his Notes, in <hi>Apocalypsis Apocalypseos,</hi> chap. 1. v. 19. And that a set of Visions of large extent, may take in some small share of time past from the Epocha, is made good in his <hi>Arithmetica Apocalyptica,</hi> if any one should scruple about these things, which it were too long here to make out. I will onely advertise the Reader, that whereas the other two Prophecies of the Apocalypse run altogether upon <hi>Real</hi> Symbols or Iconisms, <hi>viz.</hi> Representations or Images of what is foretold taken from <hi>Things,</hi> this first Prophecy runs upon <hi>Nominal</hi> or Paronomastical Iconisms, or
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49984:102"/>Images, consisting in allusion to <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Names</hi> of persons or places, which signifie the condition of matters foretold. And lastly, let the Reader take notice of this rule, That what things closely precede the Epiphonema [he that hath an ear to hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] respect the external state of the Church; But what follows it refers to a more spiritual state and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>Ʋnto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus,</hi> that is, To the Bishops or Pastours (which meaning of Angel in these Epistles, let it be sufficient here once to have noted for all) of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> succession, which begins with the beginning of the Church of Christ (which the allusion of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to <hi>Aphesis</hi> as in <hi>Hippaphesis,</hi> the emission of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers from the lists, seems to import, this being the first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out in the whole decursion of the race of the Church, to the end of all) and ends in the tenth of <hi>Nero,</hi> a short period and yet, (which still the word <hi>Ephesus</hi> by allusion may intimate) subject to change. For <hi>Aphesis</hi> signifies <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> or Remisness, as well as <hi>Emission,</hi> and this <hi>Ephesine</hi> Church is blamed, v. 4. as having left her first love. But the most plain and principal allusion of <hi>Ephesus</hi> is to <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> which signifies earnest purpose and desire through the love of Christ to advance his Kingdoms. This was their serious aim at first; as he on the white Horse with a bow in his hand aiming at the Crown which was given him, begins the Prophecy of the sealed Book. <hi>These things saith he that holdeth the seven Stars in his right hand,</hi> &amp;c. He salutes them under the Title of this part of his former Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they run the race more cheerfully that now is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, he going along with them even to the end thereof, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, comforting and guiding all the successions of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Pastours of the Church that Labour in the word and doctrine, and is in the midst of all the Successions of the Church throughout all <hi>Ages,</hi> minding their Conversation and assisting them that are true of heart, even to the end of the World.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>I know thy works.</hi> This is a form of Speech Christ makes use of to every one of the seven Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> which well agrees with the allusion to the Hebrew word <hi>Asia,</hi> signifying <hi>Action,</hi> as if they were the seven Churches in action, for from this Topick, properly is all praise and dispraise. <hi>And thou hast tryed them,</hi> &amp;c. He commends them also, that they consist and try such as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be sent from him, and to be Apostles and are not, but are lyars and deceivers, mere impostours and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. He commends them for their first great fervency, and desire of enlarging his Church or Kingdom, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing patiently all crosses and difficulties they meet with in carrying on the work, and for not fainting under so great pains and travel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>Thou hast left thy first love.</hi> There is not that earnest affection for me as at first, nor fervency and zeal for the enlargement of my Kingdom, but you are more cold and remiss.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>Remember,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> Act with that constancy, fervency and sincerity you did before, or else I will raise such a Tempest of persecution against the Church, that she shall not be able to keep her place, but be shaken and driven with the violence thereof. This therefore signifies the visible state of the Church in the next interval.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. <hi>Thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans.</hi> This seems to be inserted to intimate the narrow bounds of this first succession of the Church, that it was before <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaitism</hi> broke out. For if that had broke out then in the Church, she had stood guilty of it. But she abhorred from that uncleaness that after broke out, and was noted by the name of <hi>Nicolaitism,</hi> though she stood guilty of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misness mentioned before.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>What the Spirit saith unto the Churches,</hi> namely, in these prophetical Parables. For it is of great concern and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for them to consider and understand them, through all the Successions of the Churches, that what is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended they may follow, and eschew the contrary at all
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49984:103"/>times. <hi>To eat of the tree of Life.</hi> He that overcometh through his much labour and pains, he shall be refreshed with the food of the tree of Life, and for his patience and sufferings enjoy the pleasures of Paradise in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>The Church of Smyrna. Smyrna</hi> is the same that <hi>Myrrha</hi> Myrrh, from a Syriack word, that signifies <hi>bitter.</hi> By which therefore is understood the bitterness of affliction and persecution in this interval of the Church, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the end of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> interval to about the three hundred and twenty fourth year of Christ. <hi>The first and the last which was dead and is alive.</hi> This part of the foregoing Representation of Christ is made his Title here for an encouragement in the bloudy persecuting times the Church in this succession is in; intimating that those that dye Martyrs shall as assuredly be alive again, as Christ himself, who was once martyred and crucified. And his being the first and the last implies that he will make the Church hold out to the end, and stand Conquerour in the field.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. <hi>But thou art rich,</hi> Rich in grace, full of Christian patience, and meekness, and invincible courage against all the dangers of death. <hi>That say they are Jews and are not,</hi> &amp;c. That say they are Christians and are not (for so <hi>Jews</hi> signifie in the Apocalyptick style) and so by their dastard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and persidiousness, blaspheme and dishonour that noble name and calling, by proving themselves of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Satan, and betrayers of the Kingdom of their Lord that bought them, fast Slaves to the flesh, and impatient of all persecution, worse than <hi>Peter,</hi> whom notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he would have discouraged Christ from his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on the Cross, he sharply rebuked with a, <hi>Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me Satan,</hi> for thou savourest not the things of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>Fear none of those things,</hi> &amp;c. Nor imitate that base cowardise of that Synagogue of Satan, for they are no Church of mine, but a Cage of perfidious Hypocrites. <hi>Behold the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. The Devil and his Ministers under Paganism will cast some of you into Prison, for the tryal of your faith and constancy, ye shall have the Tribulation
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49984:103"/>of ten days, even of those ten bloudy Persecutions under the Pagan Emperours. But be in no wise discouraged, but continue faithfull unto death and I will give you a Crown of Life, even the imperial Crown, <hi>Constantine</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Christian, which will be a Crown of Life and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to you my Church, and save you from death and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution. This shall be the external effect, and fruit of your sufferings, or the political reward thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>Shall not be hurt by the second death.</hi> He that stands out this tryal and valiantly suffers Martyrdom, shall not be hurt of the second death, but have his part in the first Resurrection accordingly as it was written. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.6. Blessed and Holy is he, that has part in the first Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, on such the second death hath no power; And the ancient Fathers have thus understood it. And this El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liptical way of putting one part of a Sentence thereby to imply the other is usual in the Apocalyptick style. This therefore is the promised privilege of those Martyrs, that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered persecution in this <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Succession of the Church, under the ten hot Persecutions. And as being invisible is placed after the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> as that political promise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it: According to the rule noted above.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>The Church in Pergamus.</hi> The word <hi>Pergamus</hi> signifies the high Towers in <hi>Troy.</hi> And the Church in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus</hi> here signifies the exaltation of the Church, out of her <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Humiliation and affliction, and the excessive pride also, and Fastuosity of the idolatrous Hierarchy growing up to the top in this interval. Which reaches from the end of the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> succession, <hi>viz.</hi> from the year three hundred and twenty four, to the year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand two hundred forty two, when the Popes Legate <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> with <hi>Trancavel</hi> the bastard Son of Count <hi>Beziers</hi> ended the War of the <hi>Albigenses. Which hath the sharp Sword with two edges.</hi> Here is another Ellipsis [coming out of his mouth] being understood.

I observe how well thou carriest thy self, though thou dwellest under the Dominion and Jurisdiction of the first born of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that Man of Sin and Son of Pride, a right <hi>Pergamenian,</hi> lofty and haughty, and yet thou holdest fast to my Authority and the pure Christian profession, nor hast apostatized from the ancient faith and purity of worship untainted with Superstition and Idolatry; no not in those days when <hi>Antipas,</hi> those faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and couragious opposers of Holy Father the Pope (for so the word <hi>Antipas</hi> plainly signifies) the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenses</hi> were cruelly slain with the sword within the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of that first-born of <hi>Luciser.</hi>

You have those that comply with the Pseudo-prophet <hi>Balaam,</hi> the lofty Lord of the People (for so <hi>Balaam</hi> signifies) who hath taught <hi>Balac</hi> the Secular Power, now but a shadow or cypher, it being in this Interval <hi>evacuate</hi> in a manner (as the Name imports) by the over-topping of the power Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, to force the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that is, the Christians (of which the <hi>Israelites</hi> were a Type) to come to Mass, and by partaking thereof, to partake of Idolatry, they making, by their Idolatrous usages there, the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which is a feast upon a sacrifice, like to the feeding upon <hi>Idolothyta,</hi> upon things sacrificed unto Idols.</p>

M.</hi> his Preface to his <hi>Exposition of the seven Churches,</hi> Sect. 10, 11. And <hi>Rome</hi> is here called <hi>Thyatira</hi> in this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val for her effeminateness, but especially for her more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously worshipping the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> as the daughter of God, as they also call her, in the highest sense, more by
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49984:105"/>far than the Son of God himself. See Dr. <hi>Brevint</hi>'s <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> at <hi>Endor,</hi> chap. 5.6, 7, 8. and it will seem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to thee, but that the excess of that Idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship given to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in this Interval by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is here presigured and perstringed in this Name <hi>Thyatira</hi> as it signifies a daughter. But there is an allusion also to the Greek word <hi>Thyateria,</hi> Altars of burnt-offerings, the burning of Martyrs being so wonderfully frequent in this <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Interval, which begins at the ending of the former succession, and reacheth till the time that whole Nations forsook the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Reformation begun by <hi>Luther. Saith the Son of God.</hi> He is called the <hi>Son of man</hi> in his foregoing description, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.13. not the Son of God, yet this is part of his Title here, as speaking to those that dwell amongst them that make the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in as high a way or higher (as to worship) the daughter of God. <hi>His eyes like unto a flame of fire,</hi> denoting clearness of discernment and fiery indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation against the gross Idolatries of this Interval. <hi>And his feet like fine brass.</hi> Here's an Ellipsis again, wherein is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood [as if they burned in a furnace] which again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates the frequent burnings of the servants of Christ in this Interval.</p>

This is spoke to the Powers and Principalities held under by her. <hi>Which calleth her self a Prophetess,</hi> but is indeed a Pseudo-prophetess, a false teacher and seducer of my servants, the same with the false Prophet elsewhere mentioned in the <hi>Apocalypse. To eat things sacrificed unto
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49984:105"/>Idols.</hi> To bring them to the Communion of the Idolatrous Mass: see verse 14. Wherefore suffer no longer this <hi>Jezebel,</hi> but according to the <hi>Omen</hi> and Fate of her Name (which signifies either <hi>loathed Dung,</hi> or <hi>deprived of her dwelling</hi>) let her be cast out and reputed as the dung of the Earth. See 2 <hi>Kings</hi> chap. 9. v. 33, 37.</p>

Or I will kill them by a natural Death, namely her Emissaries and Armies that may be sent against my true Church. Which therefore may respect the ensuing succession which is under the Vials. <hi>And all the Churches shall know,</hi> &amp;c. All the Christian World shall ring of the righteousness of my judgments, who have my eyes like a bright flame of fire discerning the Hypocrisie of a painted Idolatrous Church, and burning with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against it, and in due time giving to every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his demerits.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>THE Church in Sardis.</hi> The Church in <hi>Sardis</hi> are the Reformed Churches. The Paronoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical allusions in the name <hi>Sardis</hi> are, 1. To the <hi>Lapis Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> which <hi>exhilarates</hi> the mind of him that wears it, and is an Amulet against <hi>Witchcraft</hi> and Poison, which may typifie the comfortable doctrine of Justification in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49984:108"/>Churches, and their being freed from the poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cup, and Enchantments (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.) of that <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Woman. 2. To the same stone as it is called in Hebrew <hi>Odem</hi> (which sounds near to <hi>Edom</hi>) and in Latin <hi>Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> which insinuates their <hi>Carnality</hi> in several points of doctrine and practice; of which see Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his <hi>Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the seven Churches,</hi> chap. 7. And lastly to <hi>Sardis</hi> as it signifies in Hebrew, a <hi>Song of Joy</hi> or Joy breaking out into singing, which sutes well with their Joy at the rising of the witnesses signified by those Harpers with the Harps of God in their hands, <hi>Apoc. chap.</hi> 15. The <hi>Sardian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval begins where the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> succession ends, that is, when Protestantism had become the Religion of Nations and Kingdoms; and it reaches to the last Vial, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 16. <hi>That hath the seven Spirits of God and the seven Stars.</hi> That hath in his power and disposal all the divine Graces and heavenly Hosts or Companies of Angels for the assistence of his Church, and all the Bishops and Pastours thereof (ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisied by the seven Stars) <hi>viz.</hi> in his right hand. For here occurs another <hi>Ellipsis</hi> again; And by having them in his hand is denoted their being in his power, guidance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; a description of Christ, like that in the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Church: As if it were the very beginning and Emerging again of the true Apostolick Church, that had lain hid in the Wilderness of Paganochristianism. <hi>Thou hast a Name that thou livest and art dead.</hi> I observe how mean and wretched thou art in comparison of what thou oughtest to be, and how thou hast a name that thou liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, as being so full of Zeal, for or against this <hi>Ceremony</hi> and that <hi>Opinion,</hi> with hot and nice disputes about <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Justification,</hi> but I will assure thee, be thou as full of life and activity as thou wilt about such things, if thou hast not that <hi>Faith</hi> which worketh by love, thou art nothing in my esteem. Whosoever is devoid of a due degree of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>Ʋnself-interessed love,</hi> let him be reputed to live as much as he will, he is accounted dead in my sight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>Be watchfull.</hi> Keep a guard over thine own heart, and breathe after unfeigned Charity, which is the bond of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49984:108"/>Perfection, and will prevent all Schisms and Factions, and tye the Members of reformed Christendom in one heart, and in one mind to their Governours <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> and to one another. <hi>And strengthen the things,</hi> &amp;c. Revive and corroborate in you the things that remain, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ, and of a blessed immortality after this Life; these you yet profess, though <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Atheism</hi> with <hi>Sensuality</hi> and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinism have grown much upon you, so that the belief even of these necessary things are ready to dye also. <hi>Perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,</hi> For you do not go on towards perfection, nor are you in a growing state, though you have not yet reached your due stature approveable before God, which is a sign you are in a state of Languishment and Vergency toward death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>Remember therefore how thou hast received,</hi> &amp;c. Since you profess your selves reformed into a true Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, remember what you have heard out of the Apostles writings. How I so loved my Church, that I gave my self for it, that I might sanctifie it, that I might make it a glorious Church, having neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing, but it should be Holy and without blemish. Nor let the vain glosses of any faint-hearted Hypocrites, deceive or discourage you. Remember also what ye have heard of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that Man of sin that exalts himself above all that is called God, and worshipped, and for ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon that wicked and idolatrous Communion. And take heed of that nauseous and detestable ingratitude of not setting a due value of my redeeming you from that worse, than <hi>Aegyptian</hi> or <hi>Babylonian</hi> slavery and Captivity into the Gospel Liberty. And be not imposed upon by the fine words and subtile Sophistry, of either known enemies or perfidious brethren. These and such like things as these taught by my Apostles, and repeated again by the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers be sure to hold fast, and repent of your slipperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and remisness, of your easiness and inclineableness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the flesh-pots of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the carnal Entertainments under that Mystical <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at <hi>Rome. If therefore thou
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49984:109"/>shalt not watch,</hi> &amp;c. These things therefore I strictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee and charge thee to doe, which if thou wilt not carefully and diligently observe, and have a due watch over thy ways, I will come on thee of a sudden, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize thee with some terrible judgment for thy gross in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and thou shalt not know what hour I come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, before the storm certainly overtake thee. This was to forewarn the reformed Churches, that by their time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repentance they might avoid or lessen the storm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>Thou hast a few Names even in Sardis,</hi> &amp;c. There be some few excellent persons even in <hi>Sardis</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the ill Omen of <hi>Odem,</hi> and <hi>Carnalina</hi>) and of a true Christian spirit, scattered up and down in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, who have not defiled their Garments, the inward nor outward cloathing of their Souls, nor spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the decency of their Conversation by any scandal of the flesh. These will I take into nearer Communion with me in the Spirit, and they shall advance more and more in all innocency and purity. So that their light shall shine before Men, and God be glorified in their works. For this verse refers to that common Topick in all the Epistles [I know thy works.] But the next verse tells the reward, which being before the <hi>Epiphonema</hi> is political.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>Shall be cloathed with white Rayment.</hi> They shall overcome all difficulties inward and outward, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in purity and true Holiness, they shall be cloathed in white Rayment, that is, shall be successfull and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the affairs of my Kingdom, which they endeavour to propagate. <hi>And I will not blot out his name,</hi> &amp;c. that is, This sort of Men shall continue to the <hi>Philedelphian</hi> succession, and onwards to the end of the World. And this <hi>Book of Life</hi> to them, shall be as the <hi>Crown of Life</hi> to the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> succession, shall be their security from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and death. That Church which they introduce into the World, which is the <hi>Philadelphian,</hi> shall never be brought again under the subjection, Tyranny and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of any power whatsoever. <hi>But I will confess his Name,</hi> &amp;c. I will in a special manner recommend them
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49984:109"/>to the good Providence of God, and the watchfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of his holy Angels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. <hi>He that hath an ear let him hear,</hi> &amp;c. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches especially let them take particular notice, what the Holy Ghost has here delivered touching the Church in <hi>Sardis,</hi> viz. That Christ who holds the seven Stars in his right hand, and appears thus to the reformed Churches as he did to the <hi>Ephesine,</hi> or first Apostolick Church, is as ready and serious in the renewing and reforming of his Church, as he was then in setting it on foot first in the World. And he appears as he did then walking in the midst of the golden Candlesticks (which signifies his help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full presence to his Church) so here with the succour of his divine Graces and Ministry, and assistence of his holy Angels: So that nothing is wanting to rouse us effectually out of this carnal Drousiness, toward the attainment of the Dispensation of the spirit and power, except our own sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and diligent attention to, and firm belief of the Oracles of God. So that the success of things hitherto, as to the effect of Religion in the reformed Churches lyes at our own doors. God give us grace to consider it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>The Church in Philadelphia.</hi> Philadelphia is the love of the brethren, and consequently the love of God and all Men, which in one word might be called Charity, <hi>Agape,</hi> but that's no name of any City in <hi>Asia.</hi> The <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphian</hi> succession begins where the <hi>Sardian</hi> ends, and reacheth to the fourth Thunder, including the Millennial reign of Christ. Which we may be assured is so, because the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> interval is such, as where not onely there is no Idolatry to be tempted to, nor any Martyrdom for refusing to comply therewith, but also no spot nor wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle nor any such thing, but it is entirely Holy and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemish. Which is plainly the condition of the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium</hi> or <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> state, which alone might assure us of this truth. But when <hi>v.</hi> 12. the very name of the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> is writ upon this Church, it is impossible to conceive the <hi>Millennium,</hi> not included in the <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian</hi> interval. <hi>He that is Holy, he that is True.</hi> Truth
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49984:110"/>and Holiness, is the <hi>Ʋrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> of the High Priest, in whose habit Christ appeared in the beginning. <hi>He that is Holy,</hi> and speaks to a Church that willingly listens to such Monitions as these. Be ye Holy for I am Holy, and be ye perfect as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect. <hi>He that is true,</hi> and will verifie all his glorious promises in the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> succession or blessed <hi>Millennium,</hi> to all those that trust in his word. <hi>Has the Key of David:</hi> Is the chief Minister of state to the eternal God, whom the Apostle <hi>John</hi> calls LOVE, and so <hi>David</hi> signifies. <hi>He that openeth,</hi> &amp;c. He that when he will can open the door of success to his own, and shut it again when he will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Enemies, and so administer all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>I know thy works, Behold I have set,</hi> &amp;c. I know thy works and designs, and highly approve of them, I know thou doest nothing out of bitter Zeal, faction or self-seeking, nothing out of Vain-Glory or any other worldly end, but simply out of love of me, and of my righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and out of love to all Mankind, for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of whose both present and future Happiness, thou doest all thy endeavours, and therefore I will open to thee such a door of success, as no man shall be able to shut against thee. <hi>For thou hast a little strength,</hi> &amp;c. Though thou hast but a little Force or Army (those namely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the <hi>Heros,</hi> on the white Horse, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19.) in comparison of the rest of the World, yet thou hast been valiant and stood for my word, stoutly and couragiously against all Gainsayers, and hast never behaved thy self o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than becomes a sound and faithfull Christian, and such as is resolved never to dishonour that profession or Name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. <hi>Behold I will make them,</hi> that are of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of the Devil for their Pride, falsities and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Cruelties, and yet call themselves <hi>Jews,</hi> that is, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians [nay Holy Church] the Type as above being used for the Antitype, but are so far from being so, that they really are the Synagogue of Antichrist, who under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49984:110"/>of professing Christ do most wickedly oppose him, by nulling his Laws, and barbarously murthering his true and faithfull Subjects, for not committing idolatry and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abominations they would force upon them; whereby it is manifest though they call themselves Holy Church and Christians, they are Counterfeits and Lyars: <hi>And worship before thy feet,</hi> &amp;c. Behold I will make them to come, instead of kissing the Popes slipper to worship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy feet, to be subjected unto thee, and to doe thee homage: and to acknowledge how much I have loved thee, and set thee above all the Princes of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. Because thou hast shewn all along such invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible meekness and patience in maintaining my cause, and undaunted faithfulness, I will in that great Confusion, commotion and temptation under the last Vial (which shall come upon all the World to try the Inhabitants of the Earth) keep thee and protect thee, and thou shalt be safe and victorious in all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>Behold I come quickly;</hi> Even in this last Vial, into which thou art already entered. <hi>Hold that fast,</hi> &amp;c. Thou art a Church after my own hearts desire, O <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> nor do I accuse thee of any thing, thou carriest thy self with that integrity and sincerity, onely hold fast to that perfection thou hast attained to, that thou mayst not be deprived of the Crown I intend for thee. For in thee shall be accomplished all the glorious promises concerning my Kingdom upon earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. To you that overcome, to you it shall be given to be Pillars in the Temple of my God, you shall be an Holy, sixt, and stable People, the true holy Catholick Church, that shall never fail, but shall endure till I come in the clouds to judge at the last day. And upon these lasting Pillars shall the name of my God be written, and the new nature in you shall be visible and legible as it were to all, how Heavenly it is and Divine, and how really you are that Church represented by that City in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which is called <hi>Jehovah Shamma,</hi> God is there. For your Conversation will be such, that every man will be ready

                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. <hi>The Church in Laodicea, Laodicea</hi> signifies, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the righteousness of the people, an external popular mode of righteousness (something like that which the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists</hi> call political Vertue) the inward life and spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying, which is too much the state of the Church in <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea:</hi> Or it signifies the judging of the People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause at the end of this interval Christ will come vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly to judge and Sentence all People to their final doom: Or lastly, there may be an allusion to <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s <hi>Laodicea Combusta,</hi> the Conflagration closing this Period, and therefore, This <hi>Laodicean</hi> succession reaches from the fourth Thunder till the last Judgment or <hi>Conflagration;</hi> Nor does either it, or the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> precede the <hi>Millennium,</hi> but the <hi>Laodicean</hi> succeeds it, and the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> includes it, as is demonstrated by the Answerer to <hi>S. E.</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker on the place. <hi>These things saith the Amen,</hi> &amp;c. In whom all the promises are yea and Amen. Whose faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, is seen in bringing to pass the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> state, the marvellous Purity, and external Prosperity of that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Church, and therefore we are to believe his promises of the eternal Felicity he reminds us of in this: A blessed immortality after this Life, and his visible coming to judge the quick and the dead, and his putting an end to this terrestrial Scene, though in this declining age of the Church, in this <hi>Laodicean</hi> succession, some may be too
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49984:112"/>slow to give any credit to such things. And therefore these Titles of <hi>Assuredness</hi> and <hi>Varacity</hi> are used. And he is called a faithfull witness also, because he so impartially witnesses of the state of the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> and does not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. <hi>The beginning of the Creation of God.</hi> It may be well understood of the new Creation or Constitution of things under the Gospel, which he having carried on along hitherto according to Prophecy and prediction, he is the more certainly and readily to be believed in this last Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe of things. Or taking the term [beginning] with an higher reference to that Title of his [ΑΡΧΗ'] which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects his Divinity as he is the eternal <hi>Logos,</hi> without whom nothing was made or created, then the importance of this passage is this. That as sure as he made this Earth, this habitable round World, so we may be as sure that he both can by the same power, and also will destroy it again in this <hi>Laodicean Succession</hi> by a final <hi>Conflagration,</hi> taking vengeance of the wicked and resettling all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in an eternal state of Glory.</p>

I would thou wert cold or hot.</hi> For though it be not better in it self to be quite cold, yet it were for thee, that thou mightest be the more easily convinced of thine own wants, and by repentance and mortification enter into the state of Regeneration, and be made partaker of my Spirit.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>Because thou sayst I am rich,</hi> &amp;c. Namely, whilst thou considerest that Peace and plenty, that power and rule and security from Enemies, which thou enjoyest, and the Purity of doctrine and worship, free from Superstition and Idolatry, and the abundance of both natural and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine knowledge, and clear understanding of Prophecies, by reason of their completion now, and skilfull interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy Predecessours, and universal Freedom from all Persecutions, I tell thee notwithstanding all these, thou art mistaken in thy condition, and knowest not how Poor, Blind, and Naked thou art, in that thou art destitute of the Glories and treasures of the inward Man, and art igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Mysteries of Regeneration, and of the spirit of Life in the new Birth, and art content with a covering, but not of my Spirit whereby thou dost add sin to sin. Therefore,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 18 <hi>I counsel thee to buy of me Gold,</hi> &amp;c. Gold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the fire, and so pure that it is trasparent as glass. <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> Gold, which is the new Nature or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, mine own image: And the price is, thy sincere endeavouring and breathing after that state, that thou mayst possess those durable Riches, which shall not be mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when the Elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the Earth and the works therein shall be burnt up, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Conflagration. <hi>And white Rayment,</hi> &amp;c. And buy of me white Rayment, that is, groan in thy self, O spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritless <hi>Laodicae,</hi> and desire to be cloathed with thy spiritual Tabernacle from heaven, that being so cloathed, thou mayst not be sound naked, and that the shame of thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness may not appear at the last day. <hi>And anoint thine eyes with Eye-salve,</hi> &amp;c. clear thy judgment and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by a diligent Purification of thy soul from all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of flesh and spirit, and perfect Holiness in my fear, that thou mayst see and have a right discerning in all things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 19. <hi>As many as I love I rebuke,</hi> &amp;c. As many as
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49984:113"/>I love I chasten, and I have a love to thee even for thine outward resemblance of thy deceased Sister <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and therefore I chastise thee with sharp reproofs to bring thee to an inward sense of things, and shall farther afflict thee with outward straits and distress to awaken thee. For thine enemies <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> by reason of thy remisness in Religion, security and neglect of the interest of my Kingdom will grow upon thee, and at last encompass the beloved City. Be zealous therefore and repent thee of thy dead formality and remisness in the affairs of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that so thou mayst recover the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> love and fervency. And do not complain of difficulties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 20. <hi>Behold I stand at the door and knock,</hi> &amp;c. (This verse assuredly has a moral or spiritual Sense, as well as the five foregoing) Behold I offer my aid unto you, and solicite you ever and anon by good monitions and suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and if you obey sincerely my Dictates and Succours of light and grace I offer you, and by this your sincerity open me the Door I will sup with you, I will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my nature and spirit unto you. You shall feed on my flesh which is meat indeed, and drink of my bloud which is drink indeed, and that saying shall be fulfilled in you, I in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. If any one love me and keep my word, my Father shall love him, and we will come to him and abide with him. And that I may the more effectually rouse thee up out of this dead formality and tepidity, out of this dulness and Lethargy, I add farther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 21. <hi>To him that overcometh,</hi> &amp;c. You shall not onely enjoy me and my Father in this Life, but if you will stand to the conflict, and so attain to the state of the spirit of Life and real Regeneration into the living image of my self, I will exalt you to the same happiness with my self, your Bodies being transformed into the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my glorious Body, and so fitted to ascend into the Throne which he has given me, whose Throne is heaven as earth his Footstool. Nay, you shall sit with me in my Throne and judge the Apostate Angels at the last day.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49984:114"/>This is a great and stupendious Promise, but you ought to consider that, He has promised it who is the <hi>Amen,</hi> the true and faithfull Witness, and the Beginning of the Creation of God, and therefore both will and can bring all his counsels, purposes and promises to pass. Even so Amen. The sense of this last and the foregoing Verse is irrefragably demonstrated by the Answerer against <hi>S. E.</hi> his Remarks on the place.</p>

               <p n="2">2 And immediately I was in the spirit: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sate on the throne.</p>

               <p n="4">4 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, cloathed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings, and thundrings, and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Spirits of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.</p>

Behold a door seemed to be opened in Heaven. And lo the first voice which I heard, before the Vision of the seven Churches, as of a Trumpet, talked with me, and bad me come up hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he would shew me the Representations or Prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations of things to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>And immediately I was in the spirit.</hi> Which is a sign he was again come to himself before. And being thus caught up in the spirit, in this ecstasie he presently saw a Throne set in Heaven, and one sitting on that Throne with great Majesty, as in his Chair of State, as being Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and Governour of the Universe, and specially of his Church. See verse 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>Like a Jasper and a Sardin stone.</hi> The Jasper for its <hi>firmness</hi> setting out the radical Omnipotency, or rather the necessity of existence of the indiscerpible Essence of the Divinity, the other for its <hi>redness</hi> like fire, the active power of the Divine nature, as not onely <hi>Grotius</hi> but <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chonius, Primasius, Beda, Victorinus, Rupertus, Richardus, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus,</hi> and <hi>Aretas</hi> interpret the place. Or the colour of sire, that is, of a live coal, is here made choice of as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the root of light, to shew that he that sits here is God the Father: Which answers to the appearance of fire in him that sits on the Throne in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s vision, to whom the Rain-bow belongs, which is here also mentioned in this verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>And round about the Throne,</hi> &amp;c. Here it also varies from the Vision of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> as being framed for a Type of the future state of the Church, when the new <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> descends from heaven and the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of God is with them: And therefore the four and twenty Elders are here said to be round about the Throne, as the Priests and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:49984:115"/>were pitched next the <hi>Tabernacle:</hi> But in that they wear Crowns, as well as white Rayments, it implies the Sanctity and Sovereignty <hi>(in rebus sacris)</hi> of the Kings in that state of the Church which this Type points at, those renewed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick times in the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> when the conversion of the Jews, will add the heads of their twelve Tribes to the number of the twelve Apostles, which these twenty four Elders or Princes of Nations may answer to. And in that there is no one besides God, and the Lamb here that appears to be supreme over them, it signifies that in those times the Popes pretenses will vanish, and that Kings and Princes then of the Christian profession will know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and be acknowledged by all to be in all causes, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, within their own Dominions, next and immediately under Christ supreme heads and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. And lastly, these four and twenty being Crowned, and the four Beasts, which signifie the people, not Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is a sure demonstration (against the wild freaks of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick Levellers) that the distinction betwixt Prince and People will be continued even in the blessed <hi>Millennium.</hi>

There is also mention of Lamps and fire and lightning, though no thundering, in the Vision of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which is the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the <hi>spiritual</hi> Kingdom of Christ, which is here again Typified, but as a state to come, of the Church here on earth. And the seven Lamps of fire are either <hi>all</hi> (for so seven signifies in Cabbalism) the Ministring Angels, or <hi>all</hi> the living and quickening Graces of the spirit of God.</p>

And in that it is called a <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Glass,</hi> it may signifie the pure transparent condition of the Church, which is a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude (as Sea signifies) the fixed purity thereof being ever penetrated by the presence of the seven Lamps of fire, which are the seven spirits of God. <hi>Four Beasts full of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49984:116"/>eyes before and behind.</hi> These four Beasts have plainly a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the four Beasts in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s vision but may here more particularly relate to the four Camps of <hi>Israel,</hi> which was a Type of the new <hi>Israel</hi> of God. But in that they are said to be full of eyes before and behind, it implies they look backward and forward into the Histories of times past, and into the Prophecies and predictions of things to come, for the better Management of the affairs of Christ's Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. The first Beast like a <hi>Lion,</hi> was the Standard of <hi>Juda</hi> on the <hi>East</hi> side of the camp. The second like a <hi>Calf,</hi> the Standard of <hi>Ephraim</hi> on the <hi>West</hi> side. The third with the face of a <hi>Man,</hi> the Standard of <hi>Reuben</hi> on the <hi>South</hi> side. And the fourth like a flying <hi>Eagle,</hi> the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of <hi>Dan</hi> on the <hi>North.</hi> And note that these four Beasts were thus situated in the vision of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> And that this is a Type of that Church that shall be, cast thus into four parts, the <hi>spiritual</hi> Kingdom of Christ signified in both Visions.</p>

Which implies a reverence of the divine Majesty, an activity and readiness in his service, and a carefulness over our affections, that we walk in clean paths. And their eyes without and within imply, that with the one regarding outward Objects, and with the other their own nature, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them together, they will ever behave themselves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corously, with due reverence to that which is above them in dignity, and at a due distance from those things that are unworthy of them and beneath them: And therefore if any such things be offered from without, as are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the innate light and immutable Principles of an intellectual Creature, their eyes within will easily discern the proposer to be either a Fool or an Impostour. This is the state even of the whole people of God in those days. And their reverence and devotional sense of the holy Lord
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49984:116"/>God Almighty, who fills all things and times with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Providence, is in a manner perpetual, as the rest of this verse does intimate.</p>

But the doxology being begun amongst the Beasts or People, it implies plainly the Elders are the secular Monarchs or Sovereigns, and the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> order reckoned amongst the <hi>People</hi> as distinct from the Monarchs themselves. <hi>And cast their Crowns before the Throne.</hi> In humble acknowledgment from whom and for whom they reign, even for the manifesting of the Glory, and honour, and power of God in the Kingdom of his Saints.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>For thou hast created all things,</hi> &amp;c.

Where <hi>John</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonates every good Christian that is solicitous for the affairs of the Church, and thoughtfull what will become of her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>Weep not,</hi> &amp;c. Cease to be grieved and troubled in spirit. Behold, Christ hath by his courageously fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Will of his Father obtained this privilege of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing all that is contained in this Book, and of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it to his Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. <hi>In the midst of the Throne and of the four Beasts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> Betwixt God the Father and the Church stood a Lamb with bleeding wounds upon him the blessed Jesus, Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betwixt God and Man, as he is here placed betwixt the Throne and the four Beasts. His seven Horns are the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of Power, as being he to whom all power is given in Heaven and in Earth: and his seven Eyes denote all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wisedom and counsel, and all the Angels of God at his beck to execute his counsel and his will, as the Residue of this Verse imports.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>And took the Book,</hi> &amp;c. that is, It was given to him of his Father to have so vast a foresight of things to come, from the beginning of the Church, even to the end of the World; and power, as being the Lamb with seven Horns as well as seven Eyes, to effect what was foreknown. This answers to [The Revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.] as I intimated above.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. The consideration of which wonderfull gift and power, signified by this receiving of the Book, being made so exceeding manifest in the times of the <hi>Spiritual</hi> reign of Christ in the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> which times this pompous Introduction to the Prophecy of the Sealed-book does Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie (for the four and twenty Elders belong to that State of the Church) will raise a wonderfull strain of faith and devotion in them, and admiration of the stupendious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49984:119"/>of Christ over his Church, and make them break out into prayers and praises, as is intimated here in this Verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. <hi>Sing a new Song,</hi> &amp;c. And then will they sing a <hi>new Song.</hi> They will then praise their Creatour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for that <hi>new Constitution</hi> of things, in the <hi>reign</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> (as it is written, <hi>chap.</hi> 21. And he that sate upon the Throne said, Behold I make all things new. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I will give to him that is a-thirst to drink of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life freely, that is, I will communicate to him of my spirit here, and make him partaker of eternal life hereafter in my Heavenly kingdom) nor can they then withhold from crying out. Thou, O Christ, wert worthy to have communicated unto thee so vast a comprehension of the futurity of things as is contained in this Book of Prophecies, and power to carry things on as they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, it being but a just reward of thine endearing Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings on the Cross for the Salvation of Mankind, or for the drawing all men unto thee. Note, that this whole Song of the Beasts and Elders, I mean these Archetypal Beasts and Elders, is in such sort Dramatical, that it is also Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical or Predictive of what the Ectypal Beasts and Elders will do in the blessed <hi>Millennium;</hi> when this Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> in Heaven shall descend with the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> down to the Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>And we shall reign upon Earth.</hi> We being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with thy most precious bloud on the Cross, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof we become Spiritual Kings and Priests, for Holiness and Sovereignty over all vile affections, we shall continue that desirable reign of Righteousness upon Earth in this blessed <hi>Millennium</hi> which thou hast long ago shewn to thy Church in that admirable Book of Prophecies, which by the ministry of an Angel thou didst communicate to thy beloved disciple <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. The adjoining of such a numerous company of Angels with the Beasts and Elders, which signifie the Church of Christ consisting of men upon Earth, shews farther how Holy, Heavenly and Angelical those times will be, which
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49984:119"/>this Vision signifies, and what an union and agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Church of Christ and the Angelical Hosts, God's will being then done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain,</hi> &amp;c. As by whom the State of the Church is brought to such a blessed condition upon Earth, according to the Prediction of this Book of Prophecies. Let all therefore be ascribed to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. Nay the Completion of this Book of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in those times will be such an universal Conviction of the Divinity and Sonship of Christ, that he was really and in truth the foretold <hi>Messias,</hi> the Beginner and Finisher of the Works of God to his Church, that even all intelligent Beings and Spirits, whether belonging to Heaven, Earth or Sea, yea the Infernal Spirits themselves shall in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward powers of their minds and consciences be forced to break out and confess upon the completion of this Book of Prophecies, That all Blessing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power is due unto Him that sits on the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. Unto which Doxology, the four Beasts, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church of God here upon Earth we may be sure will say <hi>Amen,</hi> and all the Kings and Princes of this truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Apostolick Church will fall down and worship him that was dead, but is now alive, and behold he liveth for evermore; that is, They will devotionally adhere to him, serve him and obey him, who according to his promise made to his Church has brought things at last to such an admirable, heavenly, holy, righteous and peacef ll consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. So glorious an effect will there be of the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophecies of this Book both as to Christ, and also to his Church. Which shews how detestable the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude is of such either shallow and frivolous, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Spirits, or cunning and obdurate Politicians, that fansying it not to sute with their worldly interest, vilifie and decry it: Whenas indeed this Book of Prophecies will prove the most effectual instrument in the hand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that may be, for the rooting out of all Atheism
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49984:120"/>and Infidelity out of the World, and converting all the Kingdoms of the Earth to the faith and profession of our Lord Jesus, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>ONE of the Seals,</hi> that is, the first Seal. <hi>One of the four Beasts.</hi> The first of the four Beasts, the <hi>Lion,</hi> whose place is toward the <hi>East.</hi> Here we may observe how some parts of the Introductory Vision are made use of in this Prophecy it self, as some parts of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of him that was seen amongst the golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks are made use of in the Prefaces of the Epistles to the Churches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>He that sate on him,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Heros</hi> on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and on a white Horse, signifies a great Commander or Emperour, righteous, prosperous and glorious in his
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49984:121"/>undertaking, and the first Beast pointing at him, the <hi>Lion</hi> on the East-side, shews he is an Emperour from the <hi>East,</hi> whenas <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> his Son came from the West. Besides, that they are forty years later than the true <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> of this Vision. Nor have any reference to the <hi>Lion.</hi> This Heros therefore is the <hi>Lion</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> that Captain of our Salvation Jesus Christ, who being ascended into glory, was yet present with his Church, affording them all succours to carry on their Spiritual War, the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospel; in order whereunto he concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the success of <hi>Vespasian</hi> and his Son <hi>Titus</hi> against the Jews. See the Answer to <hi>S. E.</hi> his Remark on this place. And these Gospel-Souldiers came from <hi>Judaea</hi> in the <hi>East.</hi> The bow in this Heros's hand denotes his aiming at a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no small moment, at a Crown that was given him; and this Bow-man hat the Mark when the Emperour <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> turned Christian. This also was the earnest desire of the <hi>Ephesine,</hi> and an express promise to the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Succession. Be thou faithfull unto Death, and I will give thee the Crown of Life; the Crown of Security from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Persecution. And lastly, this <hi>Heros</hi> on the white Horse went forth conquering and to conquer till he obtained this <hi>Crown</hi> under the sixth Seal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>I heard the second Beast;</hi> That is, The <hi>Calf</hi> or <hi>Oxe</hi> placed on the <hi>West</hi> side of the Camp.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>Another Horse that was red,</hi> &amp;c. A colour sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant enough of the effusion of bloud, as the <hi>oxe</hi> also the great slaughter, that was to be under this Seal, and the rest of the verse betokens exceeding much bloud shed on the earth under the second Seal. This Seal therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with <hi>Trajan</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and therefore an Emperour from the <hi>West.</hi> In his reign and <hi>Adrian</hi>'s his successour, there were so great Commotions in the Empire, that there were slain in those tumults and Rebellions at least fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>The third Beast,</hi> That had a face like a <hi>Man,</hi> and was placed on the <hi>South: And lo! a black Horse.</hi> The black colour betokens Gravity, Severity, Justice, which
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49984:122"/>Justice is also intimated by the face of a <hi>Man,</hi> this Beast is said to have Prudence and Justice, being the Characters of a man. Which agrees also very well with the pair of balances in the Riders hand, which argues him severe, just, frugal and provident. And the voice signifies as much in the midst of the four Beasts in the following verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. The meaning is, that the Rider of the black horse will take special care, First, That if one <hi>Choenix</hi> of Wheat be sold for a penny, that three of Barley shall be sold for a penny. Secondly, That men shall live by their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest labours, not by Theft or Rapine, <hi>Choenix</hi> signifying the food for a day, and <hi>Denarius</hi> the wages for a days la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Thirdly, there shall be no stealing nor robbing, but buying by measure, though it should prove so hard a time, that their days labour will but find them food. Fourthly, He will provide that they shall have a <hi>Choenix</hi> for a penny, <hi>viz.</hi> That the price of Bread-Corn and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Victuals shall not exceed a days wages. And so of Wine and Oil, he will take care that there be no injury done, no fraud in buying and selling there neither, nor spoil and waste by unruly Souldiers. Which prediction was egregiously fulfilled in <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> an <hi>African,</hi> and therefore an Emperour from the <hi>South,</hi> and in <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son of <hi>Mammea,</hi> both of them notorious Lovers of Justice and severe punishers of Thiefs and Robbers. To the latter the sight of an unjust Judge was so nauseous that he was ready to vomit at him, and he was famous for that Christian Motto, <hi>Do as you would be done to,</hi> which he caused to be set up in his Palace, and other publick places. They are both taken notice of for their care and provision in Bread-Corn, and other necessaries of Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>The fourth Beast,</hi> That was like a <hi>flying Eagle,</hi> and placed on the <hi>North</hi> side of the Camp.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>Behold a pale Horse,</hi> &amp;c. Which colour is very sutable to the name of the Rider, which is called <hi>Death;</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> (that is the Grave) being made a person as well as he, is his Lackey to follow him. <hi>The fourth part of the Earth,</hi> that is, almost all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which upon
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49984:122"/>due compute was then a third part of the Earth; as if this power reached three fourths of the Empire. <hi>With hunger and with death,</hi> that is, with Famine and with Pestilence. <hi>And with Beasts of the earth.</hi> Which ordinarily invade the Land in those Eastern and Southern parts in extreme Famines and Pestilences to encrease the Mortality. The beginning of this Seal is from <hi>Maximinus</hi> the <hi>Thracian,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently an Emperour from the <hi>North,</hi> as the place of the <hi>flying Eagle</hi> denotes, that notable Bird of prey and feeder on dead Carcasses, and therefore significant of the condition of this Seal, (as all the former Beasts were of theirs) under which concur so various modes of vast Mortality, the <hi>Sword, Pestilence, Famine</hi> and <hi>Wild beasts.</hi> Which Pestilence rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and overrunning in a manner the whole Empire for the space of fifteen years, and ending <hi>Anno</hi> CCLXIII, from <hi>Maximinus</hi> to this year is about the extent of this Seal. And now for the Sword in the interval of this Seal, besides that in the reign of <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Volusianus</hi> Emperours, the whole Empire in a manner was exhausted with rapine and slaughter by the Barbarians, and consequently Tillage did fail, and Famine ensue, there were not two more bloudy Beasts in the World, than <hi>Maximinus</hi> and <hi>Gallienus,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer for his cruelty called <hi>Cyclops, Busiris, Phalaris,</hi> and what not, who without Accusers or defence, caused to be killed and spoiled of their Goods no less than four thousand men; and the latter his cruelty was such, that he killed all the Male sex of whole Cities, and made nothing of slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three or four thousand of his Souldiers in a day. And there are many more examples of horrid cruelty by the Sword under this Seal, according to the prediction thereof. So admirable fully was accomplished what was predicted by these four Seals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. <hi>I saw under the Altar,</hi> &amp;c. He saw them lye at the foot of the Altar (as Sacrifices that are slain use to doe) slaughtered or martyred for their couragiously professing Christianity: For by faith and an invincible firmness of mind, and unspeakable patience they had made themselves an oblation or sacrifice for the carrying on the affairs of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49984:123"/>the Kingdom of Christ. Here is predicted the bloudy ten years Persecution begun by <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and continued by his Successour, which was the most terrible that befell the Church of God. This is the dregs of <hi>Bitterness</hi> in the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> succession of the Church, whereby the ten days of Tribulation, this persecution (by an <hi>Idiconoea</hi>) may be more particularly glanced at, as well as all the ten Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions usually so called.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>How long O Lord,</hi> &amp;c. The persecution of the Church under this Seal was so exceeding grievous, that the bloud of the Martyrs called aloud for Divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on this persecuting Empire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>White robes were given,</hi> &amp;c. They were adopted into the Society of the blessed. Those white Robes allude to the custome under the Jewish Temple, where after a due search into their Pedegree, and unblemishedness of their body by giving them, or putting on them a white vesture they were admitted into the Court of the Priests, as these to serve God in Heaven. <hi>Ʋntill their fellow servants also,</hi> &amp;c. that is, Till their fellow Christians under <hi>Licinius, Julian</hi> and the <hi>Arians</hi> should be slain, after which that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn vengeance should be taken of the bloudy Empire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the time of the Trumpets, though the sealed ones should be then preserved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>There was a great Earthquake,</hi> &amp;c. The Greek word <hi>[Seismos]</hi> may have a more general signification, and denote a Concussion, shaking and commotion of the frame of things. Which frame of things here is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Pagan Hierarchy as I may so call it, or of <hi>Gentilism,</hi> the Religion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire as <hi>Pagan.</hi> Wherein both Sun and Moon, the Dragon himself and the Office of his <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> plainly suffered an eclipse, the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours by their profession of Christianity renouncing Satan and all the wicked crew of evil Spirits under him, and would serve him no more, nor exercise the Office of his <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> as is recorded of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Constantius, Valentinianus</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> and <hi>Gratian</hi> would not so much as retain the name of <hi>Pontifex Maximus.</hi>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. All the false Gods of this diabolical Polity, the frame of the Pagan Religion, they fell from that Religious honour and worship which was given them and were tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under foot by the prevailing Christians, as also their Priests that served them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. And this Pagan Hierarchy shrivelled up with all the false Deities, and their Priests as a scrowl of parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that hides the Characters therein contained as it is rolled up. <hi>And every Mountain,</hi> &amp;c.

All sorts of men from the highest to the lowest were sorely affrighted, and dismayed at this terrible storm that came upon the Pagan Hierarchy, nor were able to resist the force thereof, not <hi>Maximianus, Galerius</hi> nor <hi>Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> nor <hi>Maximinus</hi> with <hi>Martinianus Caesar,</hi> nor <hi>Licinius,</hi> nor <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate, who all felt the irresistible power of the wrath of the Lamb, and some of them, <hi>viz.

And they shall go into the holes of the Rocks, and into the Caves of the earth for the fear of the Lord, and for the Glory of his Majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth, as he did in this shaking of the Pagan Religion of the Empire, and abolishing their Idols.</p>

So that the Church upon the Conversion of <hi>Constantine,</hi> to the Faith entred into the state of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamenian</hi> succession; being exalted out of the dust. And O that she had not been thereupon exalted so much in her own mind, and become the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> Church in the worst sense, that is, proud and cruel, as well as exalted in power.</p>

                  <p>ARG. <hi>A Vision commencing with the seventh Seal, and reaching to the last times of the Church, or the end of the</hi> Sealed-book-prophecy. <hi>The first part of this Vision set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out by the hundred forty four thousand sealed ones of the twelve Tribes of</hi> Israel <hi>twisted with the line of the first six Trumpets, an assured Number of Apostolick Christians, in which Christ's true Church would continue safe against the Incursions of the</hi> Barbarians, Saracens <hi>and</hi> Turks <hi>under the first six Trumpets, and against the prevailing War of the Beast, and enticements and cruelties of the thriving Whore,</hi> Synchronal <hi>to the said six Trumpets.

                  <p>HItherto of the first six Seals, which reach from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> into the fore part of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamenian</hi> Succession, just till the Commencement of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie. And from thence to the end of the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet (and the seven Thunders on purpose supply the place of the seventh) is the time of the Sealed ones.</p>

After the opening of the six Seals he saw the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of God's power in making war and peace, and blusters in the World, and that at that time they held all in peace as for any Incursions of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> into the Empire, so that these winds blew down no buildings on the Earth, nor caused shipwrecks on the Sea, nor broke off branches of Trees, nor tore them up by the root: Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Ships and Trees in analogy signifying Political Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49984:125"/>and Constitutions. And the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kingdom in <hi>Daniel</hi> is expresly represented by a Tree.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>From the East.</hi> The Original is <hi>[Anatole]</hi> which word is one of the Titles of Christ, he being the Day-spring from on high that has visited us. <hi>Having the Seal of the living God.</hi> Having a Commission from Christ, to set a mark of protection on such certain men from the imminent destruction now coming upon the Empire, and he therefore cries to the four Angels, who had the power to raise Tempests of War and invasion on the Empire, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to bring in those Tempests of the Barbarians till he had marked out the servants of God for deliverance and protection. Which insinuates the assured Providence of Christ over his true Church in all that confusion and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that would be under the first six Trumpets. The impress therefore of this protective Seal, though in the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex</hi> of the Prophecy it seems to be done at once, has its fulfilling all along the six Trumpets, which is about twelve hundred years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>The number of them,</hi> which is not <hi>numerally</hi> to be understood, but <hi>Symbolically</hi> denoting the condition of the sealed. For in the hundred forty four thousand, the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liads</hi> or thousands, are <hi>Cubical</hi> numbers and denote <hi>Stability</hi> or Constancy, but these <hi>Chiliads</hi> being said to be one hundred forty four, that number being a <hi>Square</hi> whose root is <hi>twelve</hi> shews in what they are thus stable, <hi>viz.</hi> in the pure Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Faith. <hi>Of all the Tribes of the Children of Israel,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the twelve Patriarchs being put for the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and the children of <hi>Israel</hi> for the Church of Christ, of which the <hi>Israelites</hi> are here a Type, as they are in the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> in which <hi>Pergamenian</hi> interval this sealing begins.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. The order is much inverted and confounded in this numbring the twelve Tribes, besides that <hi>Dan</hi> is left out, and <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s name is suppressed; because these two Tribes were the Ring-leaders to idolatry, (<hi>Judg. chap.</hi> 17.18.) But <hi>Juda</hi> is here put before <hi>Reuben,</hi> because Christ was of the Tribe of <hi>Juda.</hi> But <hi>Reuben</hi> keeps the second
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49984:126"/>place as by Birth-right, it being fit he should yield it to no other, especially his courage having been so notable in the battels of the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. and <hi>Jos.</hi> 4. <hi>Gad's</hi> valour also has purchased him the next place, besides that <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> the destroyers of <hi>Baal</hi> and his worship were of the Tribe of <hi>Gad.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. The Tribe of <hi>Aser</hi> also is notable, for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Sarepta</hi> that entertained <hi>Elias</hi> that great Champion against the <hi>Baalitish</hi> idolatry, and for <hi>Anna</hi> the Prophetess that gave Testimony to Christ, when he was presented in the Temple. And these were the first four Sons of <hi>Leah.</hi> But now <hi>Nepthali</hi> is here placed, and <hi>Manasses</hi> before their Seniours, <hi>Simeon, Levi, Issachar</hi> and <hi>Zabulon,</hi> the former because that Tribe is so much ennobled by the story of <hi>Barac</hi> the Conquerour of <hi>Sisera,</hi> and for <hi>Capernaum</hi> that See as it were of that great Bishop of Souls Jesus Christ, whose residence was so much at <hi>Capernaum</hi> a City of <hi>Galilee</hi> that belongs to <hi>Nepthali,</hi> that he was thence called a <hi>Galilean:</hi> And the latter for the feats of <hi>Gideon</hi> the destroyer of the Altar of <hi>Baal,</hi> who was of the Tribe of <hi>Manasses,</hi> as was also <hi>Elisha,</hi> upon whom the Spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> rested and was sent to anoint <hi>Jehu</hi> King that sore executioner of <hi>Jezebel.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7, 8. These four last Sons of <hi>Leah</hi> are ranked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their birth, there being nothing eximious in them; or if there was, it being blotted again by some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary miscarriages, there was no occasion of breaking the order of their birth. The Tribe of <hi>Joseph</hi> here is put for the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and his name suppressed, because of the foul faults of that Tribe in <hi>Micha, Jeroboam</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> all <hi>Ephraimites,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> juniour of all rightly placed last. But upon this account of the whole we see the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the names of the Tribes is so fitted, as to represent a Company zealous for <hi>Christ,</hi> and as zealous against <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist</hi> (as being that Virgin company with the Lamb on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> chap. 14.) and against spiritual Whoredom, which is Idolatry. This pure Apostolick Church did Christ seal and keep safe, even during all that dangerous time, under the sounding of the first six Trumpets.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. <hi>In white robes, and palms in their hands.</hi> This part of the vision therefore shoots beyond the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> and <hi>Thyatirian</hi> intervals of the Church, and begins with the <hi>Sardian,</hi> which enjoys that promise to him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, that he shall have power over the Nations, that is, whole Nations, Tongues and People are now become open professours of the pure Apostolick Faith; This is the effect of their Victory, and the sign thereof the Palm-branches in their hands: They are the same with them that have got the Victory over the Beast his image and his mark, and the number of his name, and sing the song of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Lamb, <hi>chap.</hi> 15. which is the Commencement also of the <hi>Sardian</hi> succession, which signifies a song of joy; As it is said in the next verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>Salvation unto our God,</hi> &amp;c. namely, because he has thus delivered his <hi>Israel</hi> from the Antichristian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and persecution they were under in the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> and <hi>Thyatirian</hi> successions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. What is here said may seem to strike farther into the <hi>Millennial</hi> Ages of the Church, in which Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical times the consent and Harmony of heaven and earth will be more full and Universal, and more perfectly united and accorded. So that it is no wonder, it is said that the Angels jointly with the Elders, and four Beasts did fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne on their faces and worship God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>And power and might,</hi> by which these happy and heavenly times are brought upon earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. That is to say, how comes the true Apostolick Church in these days that are here foreseen, to be so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous and victorious? For to be cloathed in white, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies so in the prophetick style.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. The meaning is, that these times of the Church which are so prosperous as well as Holy, they are so in Virtue of the great Tribulation, their Predecessours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured under the cruel and bloudy persecutions of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ: So that they have washed their Robes as it were, and made them white in the bloud of the Lamb: That is, the sufferings of Christ in his true and living members un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49984:127"/>Antichrist, were the <hi>instrumental</hi> cause of the splendid and prosperous condition of the blessed times here prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in or near the <hi>Millennium,</hi> as the bloud of the Lamb in the usual sense is justly deemed the <hi>Meritorious</hi> cause thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. <hi>And serve him day and night.</hi> Ever thankfully mindfull of the evil they are delivered from, and of the great good they enjoy. <hi>Shall dwell among them.</hi> For these are the times of <hi>Jehova Shammah,</hi> of the Tabernacle of God amongst men, the times of the <hi>New Jerusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. <hi>They shall hunger no more,</hi> &amp;c. They shall not be fals-fed nor hunger starved by deceitfull Teachers, that cannot impart to them the bread of life, nor raise the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life in them by their Ministry (as being devoid of it themselves) whereby their hunger and thirst may be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. <hi>Neither shall any Sun light on them,</hi> &amp;c. There shall no political Power whatsoever tyrannize over their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and by their persecution force them, as was usual under Antichrist, to a sapless, sensless, heartless, nay grosly superstitious and idolatrous Religion, against their own judgment, and inward sense of things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. For Christ himself by his Spirit, and by true spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Guides and Governours shall feed them, shall guide and govern them, and lead them to living Fountains of waters, and direct them into the dispensation of life, the Renovation of their inward man into the living Image of God. <hi>And God shall wipe all tears,</hi> &amp;c. They shall be no more calamitous by the wrong and persecutions of bloudy Tyrants, whether spiritual or temporal. For the true Apostolick Church, shall then be an impregnable City or Polity of it self, the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> as it is described, <hi>Apoc. chap.</hi> 21. nor shall <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ever have their Wills upon it.

Which is expressed in this Judaical way or Ceremony of the Temple, by the giving to this Angel as to a Priest much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar which was before the Throne, answering to the Altar of incense overlaid with Gold that stood before the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. That is, the desire of the true Church, who are of one mind with God, ascended up before God as incense out of a Priest's hand, and was known and accepted with him. Their prayers in all likelyhood were in general for the Preservation of the Church, and suppression of both the old and new growing Abominations of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and what the Will of God is therein, is signified in the following verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. These things betoken the wrath of God to be poured upon the bloudy persecuting <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom the Souls of the slain under the Altar had call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for vengeance, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.10. The great Tempests and Commotions that should befall it are thus expressed in the general, and as an effect of the foregoing groans and cries of God's aggrieved people.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. And therefore those Tempests and Calamities, will now more particularly be described in the several soundings of those Angels that have the seven Trumpets.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>Hail and fire mingled with bloud,</hi> &amp;c, that is, A thundering Hail-storm with fire, whereby is signified the surious incursion of the Barbarians into the Empire. And the mention of <hi>bloud</hi> seems on purpose to be added, that there may be no mistake, as if this storm was to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trees and grass, and earth, (though these be named) which bleed not, but upon men of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire great and small, <hi>Trees</hi> signifying the great ones, and <hi>Grass</hi> the common people. And that it is understood of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the [third part] plainly intimates: Which [third part] does not signifie the third part of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, but simply the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire being the third part of the known World in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time. So that here as in other places hereafter [third part] is not to be taken <hi>Numerally</hi> or proportionally, but <hi>Symbolically</hi> as a Character of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his Notes on the place. The impletion of this Trumpet began about the year 395. when <hi>Alaricus</hi> invaded the Empire with an infinite number of <hi>Goths</hi> and other Barbarians, especially in the Eastern part thereof, harassing it for sive years together. And in the year 401. the same <hi>Alaricus</hi> with <hi>Goths, Alans, Hunns</hi> broke into <hi>Italy</hi> also and besieged <hi>Honorius</hi> the Emperour in <hi>Hasta,</hi> and so terrified the Inhabitants of <hi>Italy,</hi> that they were in a manner all ready to leave their dwellings. See farther in Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his exposition on the place.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>A great mountain,</hi> &amp;c. that is to say, A great City, namely <hi>Rome</hi> it self, (for so <hi>Mountain</hi> signifies in the prophetick style, and <hi>Sea</hi> the extent of jurisdiction or dominion) which was taken by <hi>Alaricus</hi> King of the <hi>Goths</hi> (after the death of <hi>Stilico</hi>) who, <hi>Anno.</hi> 410. made a new and more fatal expedition into <hi>Italy.</hi> This case, I say, of this City being taken by <hi>Alaricus,</hi> was as if a burning Mountain had been cast into the Sea, the Earthiness and Fieryness thereof, being so contrary and mischievous to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49984:129"/>water. And so was this condition of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Territories and Jurisdiction <hi>thereof,</hi> which <hi>Sea</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, the number <hi>three</hi> or <hi>third</hi> being the Character of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. For upon this taking of the City did presently ensue the dilaceration or tearing in pieces of the <hi>Roman</hi> Jurisdiction into many Kingdoms, so that the entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Roman</hi> dominion was plainly destroyed. See farther in Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his exposition of the place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. That is, the <hi>Roman,</hi> both men and profitable Constitution of things were altered, and ceased to be what they were. Which here in Analogy to <hi>Sea</hi> are intimated to be <hi>Fishes,</hi> they being the living Creatures proper to the Sea, and plainly said to be ships. These now had lost their former propriety, and they are no longer the entire <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but each respective Kingdoms, to which they belong, to say nothing of the real destruction of many.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>Burning as it were a lamp.</hi> As if it were that fair Comet called <hi>Lampadias,</hi> which betokens the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Prince it denotes, and also the <hi>shortness</hi> of his reign. <hi>The third part of the Rivers,</hi> &amp;c. The burning of it denotes the mischief to the Rivers and Fountains, it is said to fall into. Which Rivers are <hi>Provincial</hi> Magistrates or Armies, and the Fountains of water provincial Cities. And there is mention again of the <hi>third part,</hi> that you may know the prediction belongs to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. And it is no wonder this salling Star or Comet should be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as so mischievous to Rivers and Waters, when natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral History speaks of falling Comets that have drunk up whole Rivers, so decorous is the Representation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. The condition of this Prince's reign was such, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories were so full of affliction and calamity, that their Life was <hi>bitter</hi> to them, besides the slaughter of many in Wars. Now this Prince was the <hi>Western Caesar,</hi> who from the time that <hi>Gensericus</hi> sacked and pillaged <hi>Rome</hi> (which was <hi>Anno.</hi> 455, by which time the Empire was actually divided into ten Kingdoms) strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Death for a while, in the succession of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable and unfortunate <hi>Caesar</hi>'s <hi>Avitus, Majo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

Thus did the third Trumpet sound the sad final fate of the Western <hi>Caesareate,</hi> under the figure of a great falling Star called <hi>Wormwood,</hi> which <hi>Odoacer</hi> cast down and extinguished, and reigned himself King of <hi>Italy,</hi> sixteen years, who restored to <hi>Rome</hi> her Consulate which he had taken away before. And King <hi>Theodoricus</hi> that vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and succeeded him, so rebuilt <hi>Rome</hi> and restored to it all the ancient Magistracies, Honours and Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges belonging to it, that bating the Memory of her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and Infancy, she seemed perfectly recovered to her former Glory and Felicity, and thus she continued through the reign of several Successours of <hi>Theodoricus.</hi>

The meaning is, that under this Trumpet there is nothing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Lustre of the lower or higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree left, (for that this belongs to <hi>Rome,</hi> the wonted Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter [third] plainly shews.)

In which inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious state she continued till the year 750. Which year is the <hi>Epocha,</hi> of that notable interval of the Kingdom of the <hi>Saracens</hi> from the beginning of the <hi>Caliphate</hi> of the <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidae</hi> (who first made <hi>Eagdad</hi> their imperial seat) to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. <hi>Wo, Wo, Wo,</hi> &amp;c. These Woes are denounced against the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, who by this time, besides the guilt of the bloud of the primitive Martyrs, had in a gross manner lapsed into a kind of a Pagano-christian ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, which they would more notoriously be found in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these following Trumpets, and in cruel Persecutions of the Apostolick members of the Church, that would not submit to their Idolatrous Pagano-christianism. Wherefore vengeance proportionable to their redoubled wickedness shall be poured down upon them, under the voices of the Trumpets of the three Angels that are to come.</p>

At the sounding of the fifth Trumpet, to a Star fallen from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is the key of the bottomless pit given, to raise from thence by</hi> Mahomet <hi>that Doctrine of darkness, and to Proselyte the</hi> Saracens <hi>thereto here called</hi> Locusts, <hi>with tails like Scorpions, which shall sorely vex the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire by their Incursions, but not quite destroy it. The Name of their King. At the sounding of the sixth Trumpet, the</hi> Euphratean <hi>Horsemen, the</hi> Turks, <hi>are let loose quite to destroy the Eastern Empire. The Impenitence of the Western part of the Empire notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing these great judgments on the Easten and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting still unreformed from their Idolatry, murthering of the Saints and other Abominations.</hi>

               <p>AND the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And he opened the bottomless pit, and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49984:131"/>furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened, by reason of the smoke of the pit.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth; and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but onely those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to dye, and death shall flee from them.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battel; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.</p>

               <p n="9">9 And they had breast-plates as it were breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates of iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And they had a King over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</p>

               <p n="13">13 And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar, which is before God,</p>

               <p n="15">15 And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.</p>
               <p n="17">17 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sate on them, having breast-plates of fire, and of jacinct, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire, and smoke, and brimstone.</p>
               <p n="18">18 By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.</p>
               <p n="19">19 For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood, which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. There arose an hot and hellish zeal, conjoined with dark ignorance for the Imposturous Religion of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> insomuch that the Gospel of the Sun of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was in danger to be clouded and eclipsed by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running force and false pretences of <hi>Monotheism,</hi> and of a more pure worship in <hi>Mahometism.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. Under this dark, ignorant and false pretence, the <hi>Saracens</hi> professours of this false Religion, spread themselves over the Earth, whose deadly sting and poison in their Scorpion-tails was the falsness of their Religion, which they transfused at the <hi>end</hi> of their Conquests. That was the <hi>poisonous sting</hi> to all conscientious Christians, and to others it was at least <hi>poison</hi> if not a <hi>sting.</hi>

Which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that notwithstanding the grassation of these Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours the truly Apostolick Church would be kept safe. And there is mention made of <hi>men</hi> in opposition to green things and trees; and to insinuate that these <hi>Locusts</hi> were also <hi>men,</hi> not mere Infects. For Locusts do not fall upon men, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grass and trees.</p>

But their continuance in
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49984:132"/>vexing <hi>Italy</hi> was not much above five months of years, if that may be particularly glanced at. <hi>As the torment of a Scorpion,</hi> &amp;c. Lesser at first, but increasing upon him that is struck. And the stroke being by the <hi>Serpentine</hi> Tail of the Locusts shews the poison and sting to be <hi>Diabolical,</hi> and to cause suc h Vexations of mind, as that poison is apt to breed. And as the poison of a Scorpion is <hi>White</hi> as <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollodorus</hi> relates, so it is that perversly pretended <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism</hi> of these <hi>Saracens</hi> that looks so fairly and innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on't, with which they might perplex and torment the minds of the unsealed, and sorely disquiet their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.

The fear of death and horrour of Conscience did so vex men, and fill them with Anxiety, that it was worse than death it self to be in such perpetual danger and unsettledness of things, worse than the Christians are now in, under the <hi>Turks,</hi> which were a desirable condition to them, rather than these perpetual renewed Vexations from the <hi>Saracens,</hi> in whose hands those parts of the Empire they invaded, were not to be settled as afterward it came to pass in the <hi>Turkish</hi> invasion, who seized on the Eastern part of the Empire and setled there, so that the Empire there was not onely <hi>vexed but killed,</hi> extinguished or put an end to, and the minds of the Conquered at quiet.</p>

And their success was accordingly, as is signified by their <hi>Crowns</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> on their heads. Which shews their Victory over so many Nations and Kingdoms. For in the space of eighty years or a little more, they acquired to that satanical King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Mahomet, Palestine, Syria,</hi> both <hi>the Armenias,</hi> all <hi>Asia Minor</hi> in a manner, <hi>Persia, Judaea, Aegypt, Numidia,</hi> all <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi> to the River <hi>Niger, Lusitania</hi> and <hi>Hispania;</hi> Nor were they stinted here, but won also a great part of <hi>Italy</hi> even to the Gates of <hi>Rome.</hi> To which you may add <hi>Sicily, Candia, Cyprus</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Islands. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49984:133"/>they are said to have the faces of men, the better to assure us they are no <hi>Insects,</hi> or mere locusts, nor a mere <hi>Beast-like</hi> Empire, because no Idolaters.</p>

And their teeth as the teeth of Lions, that shews that they were very dispatchfull of their prey, who could devour so many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in so little time as was above noted.</p>

Their Breast-plates of Iron import them well armed, and of an Iron courage: And here is mention of wings in allusion to the figure of Locusts, who also make a noise with their wings when they fly, but the sound of Chariots, of many Horses running to battel, implies that they are indeed men and great Warriours, that with great <hi>swiftness, noise</hi> and terrour ran down all before them. Witness the above mentioned Conquests, which were so speedy, so large and so many.</p>

They are of the <hi>Serpentine</hi> kind, of the ancient <hi>Serpent</hi> that was alway an enemy to the Son of God and his Kingdom, and this Scorpion-tail denotes that with their Conquests, they would bring in a Religion contrary to that of Christ, and destroy the worship of the Son of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an ignorant Pretence of <hi>Monotheism,</hi> as if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion were inconsistent with the worship of one God, whereas the more distinct knowledge of that one God does not make us less <hi>Monotheists</hi> than they. This is the <hi>upshot</hi> of their <hi>Victories,</hi> and the very <hi>sting</hi> and <hi>poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> their Atchievements end in. And their power to hurt men five months, is to vex and hurt the Empire particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly but not quite to destroy it as the <hi>Turks</hi> did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Nor is it said here to hurt the <hi>third</hi> part of men as in the former Trumpets, because their Invasions were not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

This King is the same with the fallen Star, to whom was given the Key of the bottomless Pit, it being an Ensign of his power in the Kingdom of darkness as I noted above. This was the supreme Captain of these Troops of Locusts, that is <hi>Saracens,</hi> and his name betokens his nature. For both <hi>Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Apollyon</hi> signifie a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer, which is a fit Title, he being the Captain of such numerous Troops, that destroyed so many mens bodies by War, and their Souls by a false Religion in opposition to Christianity, reproaching it as if it maintained the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of more Gods than one. Which malicious pretence seems also to be glanced at in those very names, <hi>Abaddon</hi> alluding to <hi>Adad,</hi> as if it were <hi>Ab-Addon,</hi> and <hi>Apollyon</hi> to <hi>Apollon, Apollo,</hi> both which names according to this allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion signifie, ONE, As if this Angel of the Abyss and his Locusts, stood up for the worship of one God, and that the Christians worshipped many, because they worship the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> which nothing but their ignorance of that Mystery, and their malice could make them conclude to be inconsistent with the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of the Deity. Which passage therefore of the Vision is no small countenance to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity of the Godhead.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>There come two woes more,</hi> namely under the founding of the next two Trumpets, which therefore as the former may well be called <hi>Wo-trumpets.</hi>

For <hi>John</hi> rapt thus into Heaven, the Temple and the throne of God was, as it were, continually repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him, and so the golden Altar which is the Altar of incense. And incense is the Symbol of the prayers, and breathing of the pure Apostolick Church oppressed and afflicted under that Antichristian and Idolatrous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of things established by the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and the fourth <hi>Lateran.</hi>

For that Angels signifie men under their conduct, is a frequent Apocalyptical figure. And the number <hi>four,</hi> may either relate to those four more notable <hi>Turkish</hi> Soltanies, on that and this side <hi>Ephrates,</hi>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:49984:134"/>that of <hi>Bagdad,</hi> that of <hi>Caesarea Cappadociae</hi> or <hi>Iconium,</hi> that of <hi>Aleppo</hi> and that of <hi>Damascus;</hi> touching which, see Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> on the place; or <hi>four</hi> may signifie onely Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically, as it does in <hi>Cabbalism,</hi> and intimate the <hi>Turkish</hi> Sultanies at large, and the <hi>Turks</hi> not to be confined to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> or <hi>Asia,</hi> but to be let into <hi>Europe,</hi> even to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>

For <hi>Trogulbec</hi> Prince of the <hi>Turks,</hi> the City <hi>Bagdad</hi> being taken by him, had his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Robes put upon him, and was inaugurated Emperour of the <hi>Turks</hi> by the Caliph <hi>Chaiim Biamvilla</hi> in the year 1057. And from this year to the year 1453. when <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> was taken, is a prophetical day and a month, and a year, that is 396. years. These <hi>Turks</hi> were prepared against a determinate time, even at the expiration of 396. years, for to slay the <hi>third</hi> part of men, not vex onely as the <hi>Saracens</hi> did, but put an end to the <hi>Eastern Roman</hi> Empire, for [third] is a Character of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire as I have already noted. Which accordingly came to pass at the taking of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and swallowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the East.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. Here is a vast definite number put for a great indefinite number, so great that the number could not so well be discovered by the eye, as signified by Speech. The numerousness of the Army intimates they are <hi>Turks,</hi> as also in that there is no notice taken of <hi>Foot,</hi> but onely of <hi>Horse,</hi> the Greek History usually calling the <hi>Turks Persians,</hi> which signifies <hi>Horsemen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. Those Horsemen when they shot off, the Air betwixt them, and the light of the beholder seemed fiery at the flashing of the Powder, and then of a jacinth colour through the blew smoke, and after filled his nostrils with the seent of Sulphur. Which shews that this Vision be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the times since the invention of Gunpowder by <hi>Berchtoldus Niger,</hi> Anno 1380. Nor were the Horses heads like heads of Lions for shape, but for the roaring noise that seemed to come from them at their Riders dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49984:134"/>their Pistols or Carbines, as it is said that out of their mouth issued fire, smoke and brimstone.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 18. <hi>The third part of men killed,</hi> i. e. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the East was not onely vexed and annoyed, but utterly vanquished and destroyed by these <hi>Centaures,</hi> as I may call them, the <hi>Turks,</hi> these <hi>Persians</hi> or <hi>Perashim</hi> men on Horseback, including both the shapes in one appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which <hi>Centaures</hi> are set out still more monstrously, as killing men by the fire and by the smoke and brimstone which issued out of their mouths, as it may seem at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance when they let off their Fireguns and Pistols.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 19. As in the Scorpio-locusts before, a Monster made up of a Locust, and of a Scorpion, to signifie the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi> so here is a Monster made up of an <hi>Horse</hi> and a <hi>Man</hi> (as the Locusts were said to have faces like men, as neither of them being Idolaters) a <hi>Centaur</hi> as it were, to signifie the <hi>Turks,</hi> and have Serpents tails whereby they are said to hurt men, signifying the same venome or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of <hi>Mahometism.</hi> For they are said to have heads in these tails, I, and had mouths too I warrant you, to speak and tempt the vanquished as the old <hi>Serpent</hi> did <hi>Eve</hi> from their obedience to God and Christ, not onely upon that false pretence, as if we Christians were guilty of <hi>Polytheism,</hi> because we worship the Holy Trinity, but also upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, then too lamentably true, that the Christian Church was defiled with intolerable superstitions and idolatries, adding the persecution of all those that would not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their wicked inventions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 20. <hi>By these plagues,</hi> The rest of the men, that is, the <hi>Western Roman</hi> Empire that was onely vexed not killed by the plagues of the <hi>Scorpio-Locusts</hi> and <hi>Euphratean Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taures,</hi> for all this sad example of God's severity on the <hi>Eastern</hi> for the like Crimes, did not repent of their wicked and impious inventions, nor ceased they to worship <hi>Demons</hi> (See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> in his notes on this verse) middle invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Powers betwixt God and men, whether Angels or the Souls of men departed; and in reference to them Idols of Gold, Silver, Brass, Stone and Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49984:135"/>that their mode of idolatry here is by <hi>Statues,</hi> not by <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</hi> this is another Insinuation that the <hi>Western</hi> Church is here understood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 21. They repented not of their murtherous Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of innocent Souls, for not submitting to their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Rites and Customs, nor of their imposturous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcisms, and Enchantments of several things to holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended uses, nor of their unnatural uncleanness of all sorts upon the Hypocritical profession of a single Life, nor of their cunning trick, of cheating the people of their Money, by setting up Images for men to bring oblations to, by their Merchandizes of hallowed Crosses, Beads, Medals and the like Trumperies and Deceits. This universal impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the Western part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire added to the <hi>Turks</hi> over-running the Eastern is the entire <hi>Visum</hi> of the sixth Trumper, or second <hi>Wo trumpet;</hi> which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ends with the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> succession, or at the rising of the Witnesses, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.14.

               <argument>
                  <p>ARG. <hi>A Vision Introductory to the third main Prophecy reaching from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World, called the</hi> Opened-book-prophecy. <hi>A mighty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel appeareth with the Book unsealed or opened in his hand. He supplies the place for the present of the sound of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet by his voice roaring like a Lion. During the space of this roaring seven Thunders utter their voices.</hi> John <hi>is bid to omit the setting down what the seven Thunders spake, in this place. The Angel swears there shall be no more time than what the sounding of the seventh Trumpet takes up of equal space with his roaring distributed into seven Thunders. By a voice out of Heaven, as at the</hi> Sealed-book-prophecy, John <hi>is here bid to take the Opened-book out of the Angel's hand and eat it, which done he is told, that he must now Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie again before many People, Nations and Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>AND I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, cloathed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the Sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,</p>
               <p n="3">3 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their voices.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:49984:136"/>
               <p n="5">5 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea, and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven,</p>
               <p n="6">6 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven and the things that therein are, and the earth and the things that therein are, and the sea and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:</p>
               <p n="7">7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the prophets.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go, and take the little book which is open, in the hand of the angel, which standeth upon the sea, and upon the earth.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And I took the little book out of the angels hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesie again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.</p>

                  <head>The NOTES.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horsemen having over-run and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd, and fully seized on the <hi>Eastern</hi> part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire under the sixth Trumpet, natural Method will prompt us to expect that what follows in this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>Sealed-book,</hi> which is the seventh Trumpet, should refer to the <hi>Western</hi> parts of the Empire, and concern the highest Dominion there, the Papal Hierarchy, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ that exalts himself above all that is called God or worshipped. Such Alterations therefore must the seventh Trumpet, distributed into seven Thunders (as the seventh Seal was into seven Trumpets) contain, as declare the downfall of Antichrist and enlarging the Kingdom of Christ in these parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and over the whole Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. This other mighty Angel cloathed with a cloud, a thick cloud charged with Thunder, is an Angel distinct from the seven Trumpet-Angels, and steppeth here in, to supply the place and occupy the space of the seventh, but is indeed Christ himself, the Rain bow on his head, as that in the Vision of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> betokening his Divinity, as coming in the glory of God the Father. And his face like the Sun, as he appeared to <hi>Saul,</hi> and in the midst of the golden Candlesticks farther intimates the same. And his feet as Pillars of fire betoken his great wrath, and his coming to judge and take vengeance of his Enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>A little book open.</hi> Which contains all the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Prophecy of the Opened-book, as we at first noted. And his setting his right foot on the Sea, and his left on the Earth, may either signifie his laying claim to, or seizing his right by Sea and Land, or his intended Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the Ten-horned Beast out of the Sea, and Two-horned Beast out of the Earth, <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Clay. See <hi>chap.</hi> 13.11.</p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:49984:137"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>As when a Lion roareth.</hi> Which is a notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation that it is Christ the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Juda.</hi> And his loud roaring being instead of the sounding of the seventh Trumpet, must be of equal extent with it, but it sets off in general the anger and victorious terrour of Christ in assaulting and overcoming the Kingdom of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist or the Papal Hierarchy, and glorious erection and continuance of his own Kingdom to the end of all things. These in general are the affairs of this last space of the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy,</hi> that is, of the seventh Trumpet, whose sound this <hi>roaring</hi> supplies. <hi>And when he had cried.</hi> The Original has it, When he did cry, or while he did cry. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Thunders uttered their voices.</hi> And therefore these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Voices of the seven Thunders, are like the seven Soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the seven Trumpets, which divide the seventh Seal into seven Intervals, so these the seventh Trumpet into seven Intervals. The seven Voices of these Thunders may be seven <hi>Bath Cols,</hi> that is, seven Oracles or Voices deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Thunder, and the last might betoken the Turning of the Earth into a Lake of fire by Thundering and Lightening, as if this were that voice, Go ye accursed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlasting fire. To which is equipollent that Lake of fire, <hi>chap.</hi> 20.15. And this dividing the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets space into Thunders, may be for that very reason made choice of, the last being not a Metaphorical, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or rather supernatural Thunder. whereby the Earth will be set on fire, and also because it sutes so well with that allusion to <hi>Laodicea combusta,</hi> from whence also the <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean</hi> Interval, which reaches to this Conflagration, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated. But this plainly implies that these Thunders reach to the end of the World, which must needs stop that fond conceit, that they precede the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>Seal up those things that the seven Thunders ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered:</hi> With an allusion to this Sealed-book of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as if he should say, Though the seventh Seal be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, yet as to this part thereof let it be as sealed again, for it is needless here so particularly to declare things,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49984:137"/>touching the destruction of the Papal Hierarchy, as also other matters, For thou shalt write them afterwards. For so the <hi>Biblia Regia, Andreas,</hi> and others reade the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>viz.</hi> And thou shalt write them hereafter, (not, <hi>[And write them not</hi>) namely in the Opened-book-prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, where these affairs of the destruction of Authoritist and the advancement of Christ's Kingdom shall be more fully and particularly delivered. Which is a marvellous manner of Transition from the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy</hi> to the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy,</hi> and sutable to the usual Majestickness of this Book of the Apocalypse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>Lifted up his hand to Heaven,</hi> as using that usual Ceremony of posture in swearing. See <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. This is a mighty and vehement asseveration, but it is concerning a thing that sunk flesh and bloud are too too incredulous of, <hi>viz.</hi> That the stage of this Earth must have an end at the last Thunder, which will bring upon it the Conflagration at the expiration of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. But the same <hi>Amen</hi> whom we meet with, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.14. does as earnestly aver it here. For he saith upon Oath (the Original being rightly pointed and transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>That there shall be time no longer,</hi> viz. here on Earth, (and from that necessary term of the <hi>Exit</hi> of the <hi>Visum</hi> of the sixth Trumpet in the foregoing Chapter) <hi>saving in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel, when he shall sound, and the mystery of God be finished, as he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to his servants the Prophets;</hi> i. e. When those Predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall be fulfilled, which in such a Mystical and Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical style God hath foretold by his Prophets, <hi>I saiah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and others, which reach to the very end of the World, or of the stage of things on this Earth. See Dr. <hi>H. M</hi> his Notes, and the Answer to <hi>S. E.</hi> his Remark on the place. And let us in the mean time note, That this earnest Assertion of the Angel, besides that weighty point, implies also, that the seven Thunders are included in the seventh Trumpet, there being no Regress here into the time of the sixth, and no time left but that of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49984:138"/>according to the Oath of the Angel. And this is the first part of this marvellous Transition from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the <hi>Sealed,</hi> to that of the <hi>Opened</hi> Book. In which first part the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy</hi> is finished, and the seven Thunders settled in the seventh Trumpet thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>And the voice which I heard from Heaven,</hi> [as of a Trumpet] (that may be understood by an usual Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly ptick Ellipsis) at the beginning of the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy. In the hand of the Angel,</hi> namely, in the hand of Christ, now in the form of an Angel, as before in the form of a Lamb, and first of all in the High Priest's Habit, according as the whole Revelation of this Book, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sling of three main Prophecies, with their Introductory Visions, is said to be the Revelation of Jesus Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> chap. 1.1.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. Though the knowledge of future things may be pleasant and tempting to the curious Reader of this Book, yet when he shall thoroughly digest it or understand it, it will be bitter by reason of the several sad and bitter things contained in it: As the sad persecution of the Primitive Christians in the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Succession of the Church, and the foul Apostaie of the Church under the reign of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ or the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the most barbarous persecutions of them that will not submit to her wicked and Idolatrous Tyranny; And there is bitterness enough for her too at the last, which makes her Paramours so loth to understand this Book of Prophecies aright.</p>
                  <p>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49984:138"/>does plainly insinuate, that (those other two Prophecies reaching from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World) he must again Prophesie of affairs reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World, and that this <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> is such, of the same extent of time with the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy,</hi> though it differ in this, That the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy</hi> chiefly sets out the fate or state of the <hi>Empire,</hi> this the fate or state of the Church. <hi>Before many peoples,</hi> &amp;c. that is, To their faces, so that they may all understand how they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Prophecy of the Opened-book. And thus is this Visionary Transition from the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy</hi> to the Visionary Transition from the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy</hi> to the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> in both the parts thereof fully finished. Now follow the Visions themselves of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened-book-prophecy, and that in a sufficiently natural and rational order, those Visions reach from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Church, being placed first, as shall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>ARG. <hi>The first Vision of the</hi> Opened-book-prophecy <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching from the beginning of the Church to the end of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Vial.</hi> John <hi>is bid to measure the Inner</hi> (open <hi>Place or) Court of the Temple, the</hi> visible <hi>Primitive Church. The</hi> visible <hi>Church after that or</hi> Outer <hi>Court is troden under foot by the Gentiles forty two months, while the two Witnesses prophesying in sackcloth one thousand two hundred sixty days are warred against by the Beast, and slaughtered three days and an half, or three times and an half, signified by the</hi> 1260 <hi>days. After three days [or Times] and an half the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in the Reformation begun by</hi> Luther <hi>are raised to life, and the tenth part of</hi> Babylon <hi>or the great City ruined, which is the close of the sound of the sixth Trumpet. An entrance into the space of the seventh Trumpet, with solemn Doxolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies for this partial fall of</hi> Babylon, <hi>or Christ's resuming in part his Kingdom into his own hands. Brief glances upon the affairs of the</hi> Vials <hi>comprized within the first Thunder of the seventh Trumpet.</hi>

               <p>AND there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesie a thousand two hundred and threescore days cloathed in sackcloth.</p>

               <p n="6">6 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to bloud, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And when they shall have finished their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit, shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And they of the people, and kindreds, and tongues, and nations, shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to be put in graves.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And they that dwell upon the earth shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them that dwelt on the earth.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And after three days and an half, the Spirit of life from God entred into them: and they stood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their feet, and great fear fell upon them which saw them.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying unto them, Come up hither. And they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies beheld them.</p>
               <p n="13">13 And the same hour was there a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49984:140"/>earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</p>
               <p n="14">14 The second wo is past, and behold, the third wo cometh quickly.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And the four and twenty elders which sate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God on their seats, fell upon their faces and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped God.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.</p>
               <p n="18">18 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy Name, small and great, and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.</p>
               <p n="19">19 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thundrings, and an earthquake, and great hail.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>And there was given to me,</hi> &amp;c. What is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Chapter is plainly a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Vision, and it immediately following <hi>John</hi>'s eating the <hi>Opened-book,</hi> and his being bid to Prophesie, it is plainly the first Vision of the <hi>Opened-book-Prophecy.</hi> Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy being ushered in with the like pomp, as that of the <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Sealed Book</hi> are, commenceth as high as they, and has the same <hi>Epocha.</hi> Besides, that it were an headless business to make this Vision to commence with the seventh Seal or first Trumpet, and hugely immethodical, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the next Chapter most assuredly beginning as high as the two former Prophecies of the <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Sealed Book:</hi> Wherefore <hi>John</hi> being bid to measure the Temple and the Altar, that is to say, the <hi>Court</hi> wherein the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the Altar stood, (See <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.33.) <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Area</hi> thereof, not the Temple nor the Altar more than the men worshipping there (which is a Key to the sense of the Vision) it declares that that time of the Church from the beginning thereof, that answers in proportion to the <hi>Inner</hi> Court of the Temple compared with the <hi>Outer,</hi> is Symmetral or sutable to the rule of the world, nor the Apostasie yet come, (its <hi>Epocha</hi> being 394) within which time the <hi>Ephesine</hi> and <hi>Smyrnean</hi> successions are included. And the correspondence is admirable betwixt the <hi>Smyrne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> succession, and that part of the Court where the Altar stood, when so many Martyrs as so many Holocausts were sacrificed in Testimony to the truth of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; the space where the Altar of Holocausts stands fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in with the space of time of the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> persecutions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>But the Outer Court of the Temple.</hi> For so it is to be rendred out of the Original, that is, the <hi>Area</hi> of the <hi>Outer</hi> Court: which plainly insinuates that the <hi>Area</hi> of the <hi>Inner</hi> Court, where the Temple and Altar stood, was also intimated before <hi>leave out, and measure it not,</hi> the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49984:141"/>has it, <hi>cast out,</hi> as rejectaneous. For it is not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensutable to the rule of God's word and Apostolick faith and Practice, but contrary and repugnant. Which time of the Church is for the greatest part of the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and all the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> in which they are said to eat things sacrificed unto Idols. <hi>For it is given to the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. That is, a kind of Pagano christianity shall visibly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer for forty two months of years, that is, 1260 years. Which is the same proportion of <hi>time</hi> to the Commensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>time</hi> of the visible Church under the <hi>Ephesine</hi> and <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi> succession and a little farther, that the proportion of <hi>space</hi> the <hi>Outer</hi> Court has to the <hi>space</hi> of the <hi>Inner</hi> Court, which proportion is as 1260 to 360, that is, the outer Court contained the inner three times and an half in large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, so that the Apostasie began in the year 394.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>Ʋnto my two Witnesses.</hi> These mournfull Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are said to be two, though never so many, partly by reason of the Type, to which they allude, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Eliah</hi> and <hi>Elishah, Zorobabel</hi> and <hi>Jeshuah,</hi> who shewed their Zeal for the purity of God's worship against the Idolatry in the Wilderness, in the <hi>Baalitish</hi> idolatry, and in the Captivity of <hi>Babylon:</hi> Partly in allusion to things, Magistracy and Ministry, Old Testament and New, <hi>&amp;c. A thousand two hundred and threescore days,</hi> &amp;c. The works of darkness were numbred by <hi>Months,</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ruler of the Night, the works of righteousness by <hi>days,</hi> of which the <hi>Sun</hi> is Moderatour. And lastly, their being clothed in Sackcloth, denotes the sadness of heart and low condition of such holy Apostolick men during this time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>Two Olive trees,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Zachary,</hi> chap. 4.11. whereby the two Olive trees upon the right side of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick, and the left is understood <hi>Zorobabel</hi> and <hi>Jeshuah</hi> those saithfull servants of God in the <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity, and the time of the mournfull Witnesses is the very time of the Whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>Fire proceedeth out of their mouth,</hi> &amp;c. This allusion is to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who did really bring down
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:49984:141"/>fire upon their enemies, but here it is to be understood Mystically of the fire of the Spirit: As it is said of the man in <hi>Esdras</hi> coming out of the Sea. And he shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them without labour by the law which is like unto fire, 2 <hi>Esdr.</hi> 13.38. In which sense is to be understood their <hi>killing</hi> them that hurt them, <hi>viz.</hi> by the power of the Spirit in conviction and prayer. These are the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of their Warfare.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. <hi>These have power to shut heaven that it rain not,</hi> &amp;c. This is figuratively spoken by a prophetical <hi>Metalepsis</hi> or <hi>Zoopoeia</hi> of the second kind, attributing that to their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, or it may be <hi>Oral</hi> denunciation, which is onely a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their condition, they having no power to sway things in Church or state. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his Notes on the place. The <hi>Rain</hi> here <hi>hindred</hi> is the sound Apostolick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and heavenly Influence thereof, the allusion is made to that of <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 17. or <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.25. And so they are said to turn waters into bloud, because their Apostolick preaching of the Gospel of meekness and peace does not take place. And to smite the Earth with all plagues as often as they will, that is, as often as occasions offer themselves. For particular occasions answer in Analogy to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Acts of Will in this prophetick <hi>Zoopoeia.</hi> Or it may be understood of denouncing all manner of plagues as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they will. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his exposition and Notes on the place.</p>

So that they shall be politically dead all of them, and some (as it happened to the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses</hi> and others) be slain in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural sense. No sooner shall they begin to perform their Office of witnessing to the truth, but they shall find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:49984:142"/>suppressed and destitute of power and so <hi>Politically</hi> dead, as their Resurrection is also political, as you shall hear anon.</p>

These Witnesses as to any political power or life being dead Carcasses (as it is said of the people of the Jews in a political sense, Shall these dry bones live?) shall be in being still, though in this political death, in the large Jurisdiction of that great City, which is Mystically called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the City where our Lord was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, that is, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> that killeth the Prophets, that far extended idolatrous Church, that for their uncleanness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their pretence of vowed Celibate is here called <hi>Sodom; Aegypt</hi> for the slavery they keep the people of God in, and the old <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for persecuting the Prophets the true Professours of the Apostolick Christianity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. <hi>Shall see their dead bodies,</hi> &amp;c. Thus devoid of all political Life and Power. <hi>Three days and an half,</hi> that is, for three times and an half, <hi>Day,</hi> signifying the same that <hi>Time</hi> in some Cases. But here it is said, three days and an half, <hi>for Decorum</hi> sake that in the out-side of the letter they may not seem to Prophesie, and be dead at the same time, nor lye too long unburyed and unrevived. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his <hi>Apology</hi> at the end of his <hi>Exposition of the visions of Daniel.</hi> But the not suffering their dead bodies to be put in the Grave, implies that they are kept safe in view, though out of all power and so politically dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. They whose hearts and minds dwell upon earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, these will ever rejoyce when the two Witnesses are slain, and more jollily and freely congratulate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Enjoyment of their Honours and Church-prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments shared amongst them, because these two Prophets tormented them, but could now doe so no more, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite out of place and power, and being ever defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their attempts to amend things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>And after three days and an half,</hi> that is, After a time and times, and half a time now current. For that measure in <hi>Daniel</hi> is that <hi>Authentick</hi> intended measure (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever varied into 42 months, 1260 days, and three days
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:49984:142"/>and an half for other purposes) to measure the <hi>Medial</hi> visions by. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his <hi>Arithmetica Apocalyptica,</hi> and the <hi>nine Queries</hi> with the Notes in his <hi>Paralipomena Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica.</hi> But in that it is here said, <hi>After</hi> three days and an half, that plainly implies the rising of the Witnesses to be the <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Issue of the 42 months War against them and the Saints. But the Spirit of Life here entring into them, intimates they began to have some political power, favour and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest with the Great ones, and their standing on their feet, that they were countenanced and supported for the very profession sake, of the pure and Apostolick faith which they witnessed, which cast the Pagano-christians into great fear they suspecting what may be the issue thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>Great voice from heaven,</hi> &amp;c. A powerfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the political Heaven (in which political Suns, Moons, Stars, Kings, Princes and Governours shine) that the Apostolick Religion be established, and the Idolatrous persecutive papal Hierarchy be abolished, and the <hi>Evangelici</hi> be advanced to the highest degrees and dignities in Church and State. Of which their ascending up to Heaven in a cloud is an Emblem. And their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies beheld them thus ascending, and you may be sure, with a malicious and envious eye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. And at this very time there was a mighty change and commotion in affairs, and no less than the tenth part of the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> fell, that is, of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> polity or Hierarchy, and there were seven thousand names of men, that is, an huge Company of men depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on that Polity (that is, on the <hi>seventh</hi> head of the Beast) wholly slain in a <hi>Political</hi> sense, deprived of power and their Revenues. For this number is to be interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not <hi>Arithmetically,</hi> but <hi>Symbolically.</hi> And the rest of that party was affrighted and surprized, they sitting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a Queen in the <hi>Thyaterian</hi> interval which thought she should find no sorrow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. <hi>The second woe is past,</hi> that is, the Interval of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wo-trumpet here endeth, namely, in the Resurrection of the Witnesses or the late blessed reformation. And that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:49984:143"/>impenitence in this Western part of the Empire is now expired with this second Woe, so many parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ceasing to worship <hi>Daemons,</hi> and Idols of Gold and Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here likewise the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> interval expires, nor is the false Prophetess <hi>Jezebel</hi> any longer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to seduce the people to commit Fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to Idols; and that promise to the Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> fulfilled, That he that overcometh should have power over the <hi>Nations</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> those that had trod down the <hi>Outer</hi> Court to the second month of the last <hi>Hexamenon,</hi> or last <hi>Semitime</hi> of the seven, which answer to the forty two months, wherein they are said to have trod it down. So that the residue of this Vision runs on into the <hi>Sardian</hi> succession of the Church, into the time of the seven Vials. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his <hi>Apology</hi> and the <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>S. E.</hi> his remarks thereon, and thou wilt be assured of the truth here delivered. <hi>The third woe cometh quickly,</hi> that is, the third Wo-trumpet or seventh Trumpet, whose first thunder is charged with the seven last plagues. This Trumpet immediately succeeds the sixth, the <hi>Visum</hi> of the sixth being fulfilled in the rising of the Witnesses.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. Several Kingdoms and Principalities as pledges of the rest, being recovered here already by Christ out of the hands of the Tyrannical Antichrist by the late Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the seventh Trumpet commenceth with great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of joy in heaven for the success, and with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py presages of the continuance of Christ's reign, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chastisements may come upon the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> for her neglects or imperfections, yet this Kingdom of Christ which has begun, shall never fail, but he shall reign to the end of the World, through the <hi>Sardian, Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian</hi> and <hi>Laodicean</hi> successions.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. These Princes in heaven are said thus to doe, betokening what those Princes and Potentates on earth, that were our noble <hi>Reformers,</hi> would doe, or how devoutly they would be affected for so blessed a Reformation. For they were in a manner Slaves to the Pope before. And so their Doxology here is more especially recorded.</p>

The beginning of the <hi>seventh Trumpet</hi> is the beginning of the <hi>Sardian</hi> succession, and of the <hi>seven Vials,</hi> and the Commencement of them all is with praises and Acclamations for this first auspicious Victory of Christ, over Antichrist or the papal Hierarchy. For the word <hi>Sardis</hi> signifies a <hi>Song of Joy.</hi> And <hi>here</hi> is the thanksgiving of the Elders, and at the beginning of the <hi>Vials,</hi> the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Lamb. Now what follows in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being after the seventh Trumpet begun to sound, must needs run into the time of the <hi>Vials,</hi> the Vision begun in the next Chapter plainly Commencing as high as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Church, as is manifest at first sight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the following verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 18. The <hi>Nations</hi> being said to be angry, denotes the anger and exulcerated rage of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which trod under foot the <hi>Outer</hi> Court, which so dementated them, that it made them impotently attempt such things that would render them execrable, odious, or despicable to all the World, this therefore glances at the <hi>first Vial.</hi> And whereas it is said <hi>thy wrath</hi> is come, and the time of the dead that they should be <hi>Judged,</hi> &amp;c. this seems to allude to the <hi>third Vial.</hi> Thou art righteous O Lord, because thou hast <hi>Judged</hi> thus. For they have shed the bloud of Saints and Prophets, and thou hast given them bloud to drink for they are worthy. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his exposition on the place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 19. <hi>And the Temple of God was opened,</hi> that is, Stood open, not just then opened, but as early as the Doxology of the Elders, as in Chapter 15. Out of which the seven Angels having the seven last Plagues are seen to come. But there is nothing here taken notice of in this Temple, but that the Ark of the Testament was seen, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that at this time God will have an eye to his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant made with the Jews, which therefore
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:49984:144"/>glances at the sixth Vial, which Interpreters usually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand of the calling of the Jews. And the Lightnings and Voices, and Thundrings, and an Earthquake and great Hail is plainly a description of the seventh Vial. So that this whole Vision in this Chapter begins with the first <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> of the Church, and endeth with the seventh Vial or the first Thunder.</p>

THis woman is the Primitive Apostolick Church before the Apostasie; cloathed with the <hi>Sun</hi> the pure light of the Gospel or Sun of Righteousness, and crowned with <hi>twelve Stars,</hi> as whose glory and crown it was to keep close to the doctrine and practice of the twelve Apostles, not yet either <hi>Judaizing</hi> or <hi>Paganizing,</hi> but kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the <hi>Moon</hi> under her foot, the <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatrous works of darkness, and the <hi>Judaical</hi> Rites and Superstitions or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Moon, the Emperess of the Night.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. These sharp Throes signifie the cruel cutting Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions the Primitive Church was under, and the many Martyrdoms they did suffer before that promise of Christ was made good to them. Fear not little flock, for it is my
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:49984:145"/>Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom. That this is the true meaning of this Vision of the Woman, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest both from the Naturalness thereof, the consent of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, and the gross defect there would be in this <hi>Opened-book-prophecy;</hi> For unless this and the sight of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> with the Dragon be understood of the Persecutions of the Primitive Church, there is nothing that prefigures them in this whole Prophecy, which is extremely absurd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. The great red <hi>Dragon,</hi> bloudy and cruel is the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Empire, the seven Heads betoken seven suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive sorts of Government, but all Idolatrous Heads, as being Heads of the <hi>Dragon;</hi> revived again in the healed Beast, and all seven crowned, to shew they are <hi>Men</hi> or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, not <hi>Hills;</hi> but the ten Horns, that belong to the seventh Head, uncrowned, to shew that the Beast here was purely Pagan, and come no farther than to the sixth Head, the <hi>Pagan</hi> Ceasars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>And his tail,</hi> &amp;c. His Military Train or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had subdued in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time the <hi>third</hi> part of the Kingdoms and Principalities of the then known World. <hi>And the Dragon stood before the woman,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Emperours and their Ministers, the Devil assisting, watched as close as they could, that the Church of Christ never should come to such power as to have an Emperour of their own Religion, and so the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, but as soon as any thing appeared tending that way, they endeavoured betimes to quash it and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>She brought forth a man-child,</hi> &amp;c. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their envious and malicious watchfulness the woman brought forth a Man-child, a Mystical Christ or Christian People, that at last would make themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Empire, and rule the wicked Persecutive Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans with such severity as they deserved. <hi>And her child,</hi> &amp;c. He was advanced to the <hi>Imperial</hi> Dignity, called the Throne of God, as Magistrates are called <hi>Elohim,</hi> Gods, in Hebrew, because they are God's Vicegerents.

But a little after this external prosperity of the pure Apostolick Church, and deliverance from the present Pagan Persecution, she was yet fain to take shelter in the Wilderness, the outward Catholick Church becoming little better in a short time. Which her speedy flight intimates, though that Wilderness-state came rather so swiftly upon her than she into it, but it is a Prophetick <hi>Hypallage.</hi> Yet however here she was more safe than under the Pagan red Dragon. And thus she was to continue 1260 days Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical, that is, years, or rather for a time, and times, and half a time, which is here signified by those days, to intimate that it is the <hi>pure</hi> Apostolick Church here meant by the Woman in the Wilderness, distinct from the gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous <hi>Whore</hi> in the Wilderness, <hi>chap.</hi> 17.

This War in Heaven betokens the like to come upon Earth, and this sight betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> implies the invisible Assistences and Oppositions of Angels good and bad, the one on the Primitive Christians side, the other on the Pagan Empire's side, during that strong Conflict betwixt the Church and the Pagans, their Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours in the <hi>Ephesine</hi> and <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Succession, with which the <hi>pangs</hi> of the <hi>woman</hi> in travail does also synchronize, and cannot begin later than this sight without gross disorder and immethodicalness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8, 9. This Victory of <hi>Michael</hi> over the Dragon (that old Serpent, with whom Christ had no small comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting long before, and called the Devil and Satan as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacher and Opposer of the Kingdom of Christ in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ages, and who seduceth the whole World into false and Idolatrous worship) signifies the destruction of the Empire as <hi>Draconick</hi> and Idolatrous, and that none of that foul stamp should be in high places of the Empire, but such as were professed Christians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>The kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ.</hi> This is contemporary with the affairs of the sixth Seal, or rather with the close thereof, and the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> Interval. <hi>Accused them before
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49984:146"/>God,</hi> &amp;c. What the Devil is said to do concerning <hi>Job,</hi> accuse him before God, the Pagans are here understood to do before the Emperours and other Magistrates of the Empire, raising most wicked calumnies against the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, as <hi>Thyestean</hi> Suppers, Incests, Adulteries, Murthers, Conspiracies against the State, and what not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. The Dragon was overcome through the Merits of Christ crucified on the Cross, and by the constancy of adherence, in the Martyrs, to the truth of the Gospel, they loving not their lives unto death. This Verse makes it plain that this battel is understood of the courage and sufferings of the Primitive Martyrs under the Pagan Powers, and that it was fought here on Earth, whatever was done in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>Rejoice ye heavens,</hi> &amp;c. Rejoice ye Angels and holy Martyrs, and ye also in the Political Heaven, in high places and offices under the Christian Emperours. But wo to the lower multitude. For the Devil enraged with his downfall, will stickle to do as much mischief amongst them as he may in behalf of his <hi>pure</hi> Paganism, which was now, he saw, likely to continue but a short time. Wherefore he will find out some fetch to strengthen the common people in their Paganism, and dissettle others in their Christian profession. See verse 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. When the Dragon was reduced to such a low base condition, an envious, revengefull, persecuting tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rose in him against the woman, the true Apostolick Church.</p>

The two wings of a great Eagle is the then <hi>Roman</hi> Christian Empire (of which an Eagle is the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol) divided into <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western,</hi> and so possessed of these two wings she is said to <hi>fly</hi> into the Wilderness, by a Prophetick <hi>Hypallage,</hi> because the Wilderness condition of the Church would come shortly upon her. In which she was safe from the red Pagan persecutive Dragon, and was there to continue for a time, and times, and half a time, or seven Semitimes, which are the measure intended for the <hi>Medial</hi> Visions.

                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. But before the commencement of this Time the Serpent, as attempting to overwhelm her before she could reach the appointed place, spews out of his mouth the water of Heresie and Contention, that sore Division of the Church by reason of that Heresie of <hi>Arianism,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that the Church that stood out the hottest Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with invincible valour against the red Dragon, may now perish by the overspreading of Heresie and intestine Division, this furious Controversie hardening the hearts of the unconverted people, and staggering the Converted in their faith and profession.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. <hi>The earth helped the woman,</hi> &amp;c. namely, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>'s Clayish Earth, the Ecclesiasticks gathered into Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenical Councils; as that first Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Orthodox Councils opening their mouths, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring against <hi>Arianism,</hi> by their Authority settled the minds of the people, and at last quite dried up this floud of Heresie and Contention, as a Torrent is dried up by the chinks and gapings of the dry Earth. Haply also there may be an Allusion to [Oecumenical] which implies Earth in it. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his <hi>Exposition</hi> on the place.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>And the Dragon was wroth,</hi> &amp;c. The former wicked project failing, the wrath of the Dragon was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain incensed against the Woman crowned with twelve Stars and the Moon under her feet, the pure Apostolick Church; and he went to make war with the remnant of her seed, those namely which she was to bring forth while she abides in the Wilderness, which will approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves her genuine off-spring by keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, who forbids us making of any graven I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, to bow down to it or worship it, and enjoins us to worship, serve and pray to himself alone. <hi>And have the Testimony of Jesus.</hi> For the Testimony of Jesus is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophecy; in which sense the two Witnesses are said to Prophesie as well as to Witness. The Testimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Jesus is to witness to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, through an assurance of the truth thereof from the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Life in the new Birth.

The vulgar <hi>Latine</hi> has it (which Mr. <hi>Mede, Cornelius à Lapide, Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> and the generality of Interpreters follow) <hi>And he stood,</hi> that is, the <hi>Dragon</hi> stood on the Sand of the Sea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Appearance of the Beast of his own Raising. For the old Serpent was at the bottom in all the doings that turned the Christian <hi>Roman</hi> Empire into a Beast again, which is here described. Whose seven Heads and ten Horns shew him to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; but the <hi>Crowns</hi> on his Horns, to be that Empire <hi>actually</hi> divided into ten King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. Which was a doing as the Empire was again relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing into a new kind of Paganism, and the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> on all its Heads shews that even in this <hi>last</hi> or <hi>seventh</hi> Head with ten Horns crowned, it was more or less Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous (for so <hi>Blasphemy</hi> here signifies) and therefore a Beast.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. And this Beast is likened to a Leopard, the <hi>Greek</hi> Kingdom for its being divided into many, to a Bear the <hi>Persian</hi> Kingdom, because this was governed much by the Counsels of their Clergy as the <hi>Persian</hi> by their <hi>Magi,</hi> to a Lion the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kingdom, for its condemning men to fire and fagot, as the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> to the fiery furnace, for not submitting to Idolatry. And whereas the Dragon is said to give his power, the word <hi>Power</hi> from the Originial, is as much as <hi>Forces</hi> or <hi>Armies,</hi> his evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or wicked Spirits, and their Weapons and Artillery, the external pomp of Images or Idols, and such gross fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of their worship, whereby they overcome and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the feeble Phancies of the people. And lastly, his giving him his Seat or Throne, and great Authority im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies onely, that this <hi>Paganechristian Imperial</hi> Power, is the genuine Successour, as <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> to the Imperial Power <hi>Pagan.</hi>

But in <hi>this</hi> succession of time, under which the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is here represented to <hi>John,</hi> it is recovered again into its former idolatrous condition, and the deadly wound was healed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing a kind of <hi>Paganochristianism.</hi> And all the World were mightily taken with the thus healed Beast, he both gratifying them with his <hi>outward</hi> specious shew of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> that seemed so contrary to the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and also having the assistence of the Dragon, <hi>viz.</hi> the Dragon-like idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and carnal Sense-striking Rites of worship, and the tricks and delusions of his wicked Spirits at their Images and Altars to deceive the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>Which gave power to the Beast.</hi> The repetition here is <hi>Elliptical,</hi> as is frequent in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> But the Sense is, they worshipped the Dragon which had given him his Armies, his Throne and great Authority, as if he had surrendred these to him as his genuine Successour, and they are said to worship <hi>Him</hi> in worshipping the <hi>Beast</hi>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:49984:150"/>(who was as well <hi>Draconick</hi> as Christian) so far as they gave obedience to the revived <hi>Paganical</hi> and idolatrous Rites of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> whose Fiends or Goblins might please themselves to receive that worship at their Altars or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that they had by their jugling tricks and false Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles re-introduced into the Church, and flear amongst themselves at the Imposture, that they made the Church in so gross a Sense become the worshippers of <hi>Devils</hi> as it is said in the sixth Trumpet. See Dr. <hi>Brevint,</hi> his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel and Saul at Endor. Who is able to make War,</hi> &amp;c. Things are so well setled this Paganochristian way, and so accommodately to all mens likings, that neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Pagan</hi> can be able to dissettle the Peace of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in this point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. Farthermore this Beast spake great and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Blasphemies, made decrees for Idolatries of several sorts. For <hi>Blasphemy</hi> in Scripture often signifies Idolatry, and he was to continue or make War <hi>prosperously</hi> for forty two months, that is for a time or times, and half a time expressed here by forty two months, as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under foot the <hi>Outer</hi> Court, is to Characterize them as Children of the <hi>Night,</hi> of which the <hi>Moon</hi> is Governess.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. <hi>Against God, to blaspheme his Name.</hi> By giving his incommunicable Name to Idols or Images, or <hi>Name</hi> may signifie <hi>Person,</hi> and so his Person is blasphemed by <hi>Idolatry</hi> in worshipping any other Person besides God or Christ. <hi>And his Tabernacle,</hi> viz. The body of Christ, which is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Tabernacle of God, the gross abuses put upon it upon the account of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is obvious for every one to note. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> on the place. <hi>And them that dwell in Heaven,</hi> i. e. Saints and Angels, whom they do reproach in that they set up Idols, by the instigation of evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and do call these Idols by the names of the Saints or Angels, and impute the tricks playd at their Altars or Images in behalf of Idolatry, to the <hi>Saints,</hi> when they are the delusions of these <hi>Goblins</hi> or <hi>Devils.</hi> Besides it is a gross reproach to the Saints and Angels, to suppose they will accept of <hi>Religious</hi> worship, and so prove <hi>Rebels</hi> to God.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>To make war with the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. To oppose them and subdue them, and keep them under all along, that they shall have no sway in the Empire to hinder or redress Corruptions, as it was said before of the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Witnesses, that they were <hi>Politically</hi> dead all the three times and an half in a manner. But in some part of this time the War and slaughter or killing is not Mystical but Proper. For by the War against the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> were killed ten hundred thousand. By the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within thirty years an hundred and fifty thousand. And <hi>Sanders</hi> the <hi>Jesuite</hi> reports an infinite number of <hi>Lollards</hi> and <hi>Sacramentarians</hi> through <hi>Europe,</hi> burnt with fire and fagot, but excuses the matter as not done by the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> but the <hi>secular</hi> Magistrate, that is, <hi>Jezebel</hi> excites, but <hi>Ahab</hi> the secular Power commands to be executed her bloudy Suggestions against <hi>Naboth,</hi> those that have the Witnesses of Jesus the Spirit of Prophecy, as is elsewhere explained. <hi>And power was given him,</hi> &amp;c. namely, that he might persecute and force men to Idolatrous worship in all the parts of the Empire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. And all whose minds are fixed on earthly things, shall obey his idolatrous Edicts and Commands, namely, such as are not of the number of the <hi>called</hi> and <hi>chosen</hi> as they are termed, <hi>chap.</hi> 17. Nor of those that are <hi>redeemed from the Earth,</hi> as they are described, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. For those will ever stand out till they get the Victory over the Beast.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. For this was a remarkable intimation and worth the observing, as also that which follows in the next verse, of a Parabolical construction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. That power which in the forty two months War of the Beast <hi>domineers</hi> so, and forces men to their Idolatrous worship, shall at last be led captive into the Truth, and they that kill now with the <hi>sword</hi> of <hi>Persecution,</hi> shall be slain with the <hi>sword</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the Word of God, answerable to the Witnesses, slaying their enemies by the fire that comes out of their mouth. Which victory was obtained in the resurrection of the Witnesses, and partial fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> from about the middle of the second month,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:49984:151"/>to the middle of the fifth of the last <hi>Hexamenon</hi> or <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> viz. in the late blessed Reformation begun by <hi>Luther.</hi> This was the promise, and the patience, and Faith of the Saints were exercised in expecting when God would make good his word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>Coming out of the Earth.</hi> Out of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s clayish Earth, as it signifies <hi>chap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 16. where <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Councils are glanced at, which though laudable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet the two horned Beast grew out of them, by the abuse of that power of determining Controversies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when once they had got the Custome not to mind what was true and Christian, but what was for interest of Holy Church, though never so worldly and secular. Out of this grew the greatness of the <hi>two horned</hi> Beast, whose <hi>two horns</hi> allude either to the pretence of their power from the Lamb Christ of <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>loosing,</hi> or to the Bishops <hi>two horned Miter,</hi> or to the two chief Summities of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal Hierarchy universal, <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western,</hi> the two <hi>Patriarchates</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> And in that he is said to <hi>speak</hi> like a <hi>Dragon,</hi> it denotes his making decrees for Idolatrous practices, and for the persecuting of such as would not submit to them. This was the voice of the old <hi>Dragon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>All the power of the first Beast,</hi> viz. His whole power he hath in Religion. For the power of approving things in Religion, and passing it into a Law, is in the <hi>secular</hi> supreme Magistrate, not in the Clergy. But this <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Hierarchy claimed <hi>all</hi> this Power, and exercised it accordingly in the behalf of the <hi>former</hi> Beast, as he suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the <hi>Dragon</hi> in his <hi>Dragon</hi>-like power and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And under pretence of this power in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he maketh men to worship the <hi>first</hi> Beast the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon himself</hi> (as appears from <hi>chap.</hi> 12.3.) <hi>recovered</hi> heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or revived. But by what art this was done, follows in the next verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. <hi>He doth great Wonders,</hi> &amp;c. As if he were another <hi>Elias</hi> to fetch down fire from heaven. But this is not literally, but Mystically to be understood, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:49984:151"/>of the <hi>thundering</hi> Excommunications of the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, whereby those that did not obey the voice of this Beast, though it was the voice of the <hi>Dragon</hi> appointing idolatrous worship, were rent off from the Church and made obnoxious to <hi>eternal Fire.</hi> See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his Notes on the place, what is a greater wonder-working Power than this? And yet this great wonder this two horned Beast does in the sight of men, that is, they are such fools as to believe he does it. And <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh, when he had excommunicated the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, said he was <hi>Fulmine afflatus,</hi> Thunder-struck by him. These things I confess, are rather a shew of Miracles than Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but Antichrist was to come with <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>feigned</hi> Miracles. And if there might be any thing extraordinary, it is imputable to the forces of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that were bequeathed by the <hi>Dragon,</hi> to the Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Empire, and the two horned Beast claiming and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the power of ordering the Empire in matters of Religion they naturally fell to his share.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. But whether by these shews of Miracles, or real odd things done by the forces of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>two horned</hi> Beast so deceives the World thereby, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suades them to make an image to the Beast that had the wound by the Sword (namely, in the fight with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> and the Martyrs, who overcame this Beast, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dragon</hi> and his <hi>pure</hi> Paganism) and by this means he lived or revived again, <hi>i. e.</hi> The old <hi>Dragon</hi> or Pagan super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and idolatry was very lively re-introduced in this Image the <hi>two horned</hi> Beast made by making the Empire thus idolatrous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. And this Image was no Spiritless Image, slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish and harmless like an inanimate Statue. For the <hi>two-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> Beast had a way to transfuse spirit and life into it, and make it speak and command that as many as would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that is, obey the Image of the Beast, namely, <hi>himself,</hi> the <hi>secular</hi> Idolatrous power of the Empire, should be killed. Which power of so commanding to kill, which is the Spirit of the Image of the Beast is derived from the <hi>two-horned</hi>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:49984:152"/>Beast or <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Hierarchy, the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no power to kill any one for matters of Religion, but whom the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> power has declared Heretick. Then is he delivered up to the <hi>secular</hi> Power, or <hi>ten hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> Beast. For the two-horned Beast (as they Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically excuse themselves) kills none himself, but delivers up to the secular Magistrate, according to this very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. And this <hi>Image of the Beast</hi> causes all sorts and degrees of men, to receive a mark as Souldiers or Servants do of their General or Master, that is, they must make open profession to whom they belong.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. No man not marked with the name of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast (for Antichrist will have his marked Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as well as Christ has his) or the number of his Name, that has not either his name in <hi>Letters</hi> or in <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi> containing the number which the Letters of his name make according to their numeral value, that is, he that professeth not himself of the Faith of this <hi>Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal</hi> Hierarchy, signified by this two-horned Beast, may neither buy nor sell, but they are excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Hereticks, with whom by the very Sentence of their Synods, there is to be no Negotiation. But now <hi>who</hi> this <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast more particularly is, is hinted Aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically in the following verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. Here is a dark Riddle, let him that has skill that way, number the number of the Beast. For it is not so strange a number, but that it may be numbred by the Art of <hi>Man,</hi> and his number is 666. which is to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred no otherwise than by the extraction of the square Root, which is 25. Which is marvellously applicable to the City and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as 12 the Root of 144. to the New <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his <hi>Mystery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> lib. 5. chap. 16. sect. 8. And that you may be sure this Sacerdotal Hierarchy of <hi>Rome</hi> is more specially aimed at in this Vision, take another easie Sense of it [It is the number of a man] that is, of a Man's name. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove there is mention of the number of his Name: And
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:49984:152"/>his name will prove <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>(Latinos.)</hi> For those Letters in their numeral value make just, 666. which is a Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listical device, and by the <hi>Cabbalists</hi> called <hi>Gematria.</hi> From whence we see that the pinch of this Prophetick Vision at last lights more particularly on the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Clergy. Whose Bishops in Subscriptions at Councils are styled, the <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> on the place.</p>

               <p>AND I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Fathers name written in their foreheads.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:49984:153"/>and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:</p>
               <p n="3">3 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song, but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.</p>

               <p n="5">5 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.</p>

               <p n="7">7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven and earth, and the sea and the fountains of waters.</p>

               <p n="9">9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,</p>
               <p n="10">10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented

                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. THE Lamb here on Mount <hi>Sion</hi> is Christ against Antichrist, and the Company with him having his Fathers Name written in their foreheads are the <hi>marked Souldiers</hi> of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> answering to the <hi>Souldiers</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> employ'd in the forty two months war against them, in the foregoing Chapter. Instead of receiving the <hi>mark</hi> of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast in their right hand, or on their foreheads, they have the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> and his <hi>Son</hi> marked on their <hi>foreheads,</hi> that you may see whose Souldiers they are, and in that they are said to be 144 Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments or <hi>Chiliads,</hi> it denotes that they are pure Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Christians, the Square Root of 144 being 12. This Root 12 therefore denotes the Apostolick Church as the Root 25 the Church apostatizing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. This is the description of the Angelical Musick in Heaven, where multitudes of Angels praise God and the Lamb, the voice of many Waters and Thunder being Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols of a multitude speaking or singing together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. This Song of the Angelical Quire is the joy that ariseth from the New Nature, or the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature added to the <hi>Animal</hi> Nature, and is the same in Men and Angels, I mean <hi>Regenerate</hi> Men, who thereby are made partakers of the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature as well as the Angels. None could learn this Song, or know what belongs to the Joys of the New Birth or Divine Life raised in us, that state of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost, but the 144000
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:49984:154"/>redeemed from the Earth, that is, from the earthly Sense and Wisedom that favours onely the things of this World, and of the flesh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. These are they that have so holy and chast a sense in the duties of divine worship, that they abhor from every thing that has any shew of violating that Loyalty and Fidelity they owe to God or Christ, to whom alone they are betrothed, and therefore they have nothing to doe with the Daughters of <hi>Babylon</hi> that famous Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the earth. But they follow the Lamb, are led by his word and spirit, not by a blind implicit Faith in a Church, not onely fallible, but fallacious and deceitfull, most of their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions both in doctrine and worship, being upheld for their own worldly Interest. But these were redeemed from the Rabble of the deluded, being the first fruits after the Apostasie begun of Apostolick Christians, and but an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in comparison of those multitudes, that will appear after the first dissolution of the Papal Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. In these there was no Hypocrisie or dissembling, but they professed the truth from their hearts and concealed it not, and though at the Tribunal of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> they are condemned for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and deemed men not worthy to live or dye an ordinary death, yet before the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and in his Judgment they are <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. I saw another Angel, distinct from this Quire of Angels, flying in the midst of Heaven, that he might be seen and heard of all the Christian world, as well the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi> as <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire, reminding them of the everlasting righteousness, Law or Religion, that Christ according to <hi>Daniel</hi> was to bring in, which is the pure Apostolick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, unsophisticated with the Superstitions and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of either <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which Hay and Stubble is to be burnt up, but that Apostolick Gospel to be <hi>eternal,</hi> never to fail but to spread over all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>Fear God,</hi> &amp;c. None but God the Father and the Son with the Spirit, who created all things, is to be worshipped. <hi>The Gods that have not made the Heavens and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:49984:155"/>the Earth, they shall perish from the Earth, and from under Heaven,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> foretells. This is a plain declaration against giving any Religious worship to any but God alone, and a Commination or threatning ill success, and heavy Judgement to all Saint-worshippers and Image-worshippers, or whatever other idolaters in the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Church. The voice of this Angel (which is the voice of holy Men, presaging and declaring the Judgments of God against the idolatrous and bloudy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire) may commence as high as the first Wo-trumpet, and might be loudest upon the taking of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the subduing the whole <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire to the <hi>Turk.</hi> Which manifested that the hour of God's judgment was come upon the Idolaters indeed, though the <hi>Western</hi> Church would take no notice thereof, nor repented of the works of their hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> chap. 9.20. And therefore if we hear news of the hand of God upon the western Church also, I mean upon the idolatrous Hierarchy thereof (which is more particularly styled <hi>Babylon</hi>) by the next Angel, we need not be much surprized.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. This considerable, though but partial <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> the great City, or Hierarchical Polity, which is the issue of the forty two months War of the Beast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the Reformation begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> when so many Kingdoms, Principalities and Provinces fell off from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was a pledge of her farther Ruine. And this was because she had made all Nations, the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi> as well as the <hi>Western</hi> Church (as may be observed in the Popes activity at the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and his excommunicating the <hi>Iconoclast</hi> Emperours) drink of the Philtre she had mingled for them, the Love-poison, or Love-potion of her Fornication, by which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood <hi>Idolatry,</hi> And here ends the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9, 10, 11. <hi>And the third Angel,</hi> &amp;c. The foregoing Angel being the Messenger of the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and consequently of the rising of the Witnesses, what follows belongs to the times of the Vials in the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:49984:155"/>interval. And therefore this third Angel more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly relates to the effusion of the fourth Vial in the Mystical sense, whereby is most fully evidenced the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable condition of them, that yield obedience to the Beast and his Image (the spiritual and secular power, in such things as are idolatrous, and are the very strokes and Lineaments of the Image of the Beast) and who make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of, or promote and Countenance the Romish ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Religion, they shall drink of the Cup of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Malediction from the Lord, and be condemned to those infernal and eternal flames. This is the condition (as the Mystical sense of the fourth Vial also imports) of them, who under the voice of this third Angel, shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the gross Idolatries and other foul corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome. And they have no rest,</hi> &amp;c. Truth against the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will be then so clear, that no man that has any Conscience can be of that profession, but it will lye exceeding unevenly in his mind, and put him in a restless and unsatisfied condition, it appearing so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly against all Sense, Reason, Honesty, Loyalty, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all those sound and sacred Principles that God hath implanted in the nature of man, wherefore in those days no honest hearted Christian will indure to submit to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> From whence is what follows in the next verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>Here is the Patience of the Saints.</hi> This is the time, <hi>viz.</hi> under the voice of this third Angel, or under the fourth Vial, in the Mystical sense thereof, wherein the Patience of the Saints will be tryed, the carnal power of the Enemy, endeavouring to force them against so great light (at which that power is the more inraged) to submit to their Idolatrous and Antichristian Doctrines, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices by cruel Persecutions. <hi>Here are they that keep the Commandments,</hi> &amp;c. Here are they that keep to the pure Faith and Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles. And surely God will in due time give to the sufferings of such holy and sincere Souls suitable Success, as is intimated in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verse.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. <hi>That dye in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. That have dyed as Martyrs in witness to his truth, against the abominable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of that idolatrous Church. From henceforth are they blessed, that is, from this time of the <hi>Sardian</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val which falls in with the <hi>fifth Vial,</hi> under which the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Beast shall be full of darkness, and the Scales turned considerably, and nearer approaches made toward the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> state, which commenceth with the <hi>reign</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the <hi>Cabbalists</hi> call it, and therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>Yea saith the Spirit.</hi> The Spirit that is to bring on those days, sets his Seal thereto, that not onely those Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs shall rest from their labours, but that their works shall follow them, that is, the good effect or success of their works and labour here, which are the <hi>hoped Consequences</hi> thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> The overthrow of that Salvage and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tyranny of a bloudy idolatrous Church, and the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advancement of Christ's Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. This is Christ that Son of man in <hi>Daniel,</hi> who is said to come with the clouds of Heaven, as if they were his Chariot, and Dominion and Glory and a Kingdom, as here a Crown, is said to be given unto him; And that he himself here appears with his Sickle in his hand to reap, is very agreeable to what was intimated before of the <hi>reign</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the approach thereof: For what he is said to doe by himself, is by the Ministery of his Spirit in Counterdistinction to humane and carnal means.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. This other Angel represents the holy Church, and her earnest and sincere devotion for the enlargement of the Kingdom of Christ, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has noted, and is more expresly signified by his crying a loud to the Angel, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the cloud to thrust in his Sickle, because the harvest of the Earth is ripe; like that of our blessed Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are white already to the harvest.</hi>

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:49984:156"/>Faith of Christ is prefigured, which will prove a farther enlargement of his Kingdom; these Kings of the East, as they are called in the sixth Vial, being adjoined thereto. But the most Universal Conquest of all follows in the next Representation, which synchronizeth with the seventh Vial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>Which is in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. This Angel being to be Vintager, there is mention made of <hi>Heaven</hi> to intimate his <hi>Heavenly</hi> Mission, that he is sent from God, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately assisted by his Spirit. The appearance of which <hi>reign</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> will be eminent under this seventh Vial which synchronizeth with the Vision of the Rider of the white Horse with a sharp sword coming out of his mouth, as this Angel is said to have a sharp sickle, which fitly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the sharp sword. Both of them signifie the cutting <hi>Convictiveness</hi> of the Word and Spirit in the powerfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ in those days.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 18. <hi>Came out from the Altar,</hi> &amp;c. The Altar as else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, in the Apocalypse, is a Symbol of the sacrifice of Martyrdom. And here is mention of fire, because that kind of Martyrdom was so frequently inflicted by that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this Angel's crying out to the other to thrust in his sharp sickle, is for vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Den of cruel Murtherers and Idolaters, by the Conversion of such a multitude as would be sure to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run them and overpower them. For the grapes are fully ripe, says he, that is, some are in a full ripeness and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness for <hi>Conversion,</hi> and others by reason of their heinous sinfulness and obstinacy are fully ripe for <hi>utter destruction.</hi>

What carefulness it wrought in you, what indignation, what vehement desire, what revenge. Here Christ that is said to tread the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press of God's wrath alone, treads and squeezeth out the corrupt bloud of <hi>Edom.</hi> And in the Vision which is paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49984:157"/>to this, <hi>chap.</hi> 19. his Vesture is said to be dipt in bloud, and that he treadeth the Wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God. Which plainly shews that these two Visions tend to one and the same thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 20. <hi>Troden without the City,</hi> i. e. This powerfull <hi>Conviction</hi> neither begun in, nor reached to the City of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy or Polity (for wood and stone is not here meant, but a Polity or Society of men) as is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in the seventh Vial, that though the Cities of the <hi>Nations</hi> fell by those powerfull <hi>Boanergeses,</hi> yet this <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> the great, though Hail-stones of a Talent weight fell upon them, were not converted nor convinced in their conscience, but blasphemed God, because of the plague of the Hail, it was so exceeding great. And in the Vision of the Rider of the white Horse, <hi>chap.</hi> 19. the <hi>false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> with the <hi>Beast</hi> were taken alive and their power aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, but it was the rest onely that were <hi>slain</hi> with the <hi>sword</hi> that proceeded out of the mouth of him that sate on the white Horse. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> on the place. The bloud coming out of the Wine-press, even to the Horse-Bridles, this again shews plainly that the Vision of the <hi>Rider of the white Horse</hi> and his Company, and this of the <hi>Wine-press</hi> is all one, and that there the garment of that Rider was seen dipt in bloud. And there being so deep a Lake of bloud, of such an extent as of sixteen Hecatontads or Centuries of furlongs equal to two hundred miles; that also assures us, that this slaughter is not literally, nor the Number nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically, but symbolically to be understood, the Root of <hi>sixteen</hi> being <hi>four,</hi> a Symbol of <hi>Ʋniversality</hi> with the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorcans</hi> and <hi>Cabbalists.</hi> Wherefore this signifies a vast, large, and, as it were, universal Victory of the Gospel, in the battel of that <hi>great</hi> Day of God Almighty, to which the Kings of the Earth and of the <hi>whole World</hi> are gathered, and the defeat is <hi>proportionable.</hi> For upon this defeat all the Kingdoms of the World will become the Kingdoms of God and of his Christ.

                  <p>THE two foregoing Visions of this <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> reached from the beginning of the Church to the end of the last Vial, comprizing the <hi>Ephesine, Smyrnean, Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian, Thyatirian, Sardian,</hi> and part of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Interval. This Vision therefore beginning later, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to right method is set after the two former, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing but with the <hi>Sardian</hi> Interval.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>The seven last plagues.</hi> Which therefore in all reason are to be in the <hi>last Wo-Trumpet,</hi> and the second <hi>Wo-Trumpet</hi> was past at the Rising of the Witnesses. And therefore the effusion of the Vials must be after the Rising of the Witnesses. <hi>Is filled up the wrath of God,</hi> Namely against the Beast or <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, which was punished considerably at the Rising of the Witnesses, the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion begun by <hi>Luther;</hi> but before these Vials be over, in the cup which she has filled, it will be filled to her double.</p>

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:49984:158"/>the Sea made the mixture more like fire. <hi>Had gotten the victory over the Beast,</hi> &amp;c.

But in the mean time it is plain here, that <hi>Rome</hi> is that Spiritual <hi>Aegypt</hi> wherein the Witnesses were slain, and the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thereof; And that this Song of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Lamb answers to the Doxology of the Elders upon the Rising of the Witnesses, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. and the joyfull News of the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> chap. 14.8. and that as it is manifest here that the <hi>full</hi> effusion of the Vials follows this Song of the Lamb, so a more imperfect <hi>glancing</hi> at them follows the said Doxology of the Elders, and the joyfull News of the fall of <hi>Babylon. Shall come and worship before thee.</hi> This
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:49984:159"/>implies, that this first Victory is but the first fruits of that enlargement God intends for the Kingdom of his Son, and that therefore it is the Victory of the above-said Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>

But it must be an <hi>external visible</hi> Victory of the Protestants over the Pagano-christians, as that passage of the Song im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. For thy judgments are manifest. <hi>The Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony in Heaven was opened,</hi> namely, After this Song of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Lamb <hi>John</hi> saw it stand open, as it in all likelihood stood open after the Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Elders, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. though mention of its stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding open is not made till the Ark of the Covenant is said to be seen there.</p>

That one Beast is the first Beast the <hi>Lion,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Military Beast, and a Beast of anger and courage; And the Vials being said to be full of the wrath of <hi>God,</hi> intimates that these Ministers were to be actuated not by any <hi>private</hi> spleen, but by the <hi>just wrath</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth onely against obstinate Hypocrites and Sinners. And here the Angels <hi>not receiving</hi> their Vials till after the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Lamb, or of the risen Witnesses; this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain assures us, that the effusion of the Vials is after <hi>their</hi> Rising, after the sixth Trumpet.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. There will be much cloudiness and confusion in God's exerting his glorious power in taking vengeance on the Beast and false Prophet by the effusion of the Vials, till he be taken and cast out into the Lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, and so all Idolatrous and Tyrannical Power be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished

               <p>AND I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And the first went, and poured out his vial up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous

               <p n="3">3 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the bloud of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became bloud.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus:</p>
               <p n="6">6 For they have shed the bloud of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them bloud to drink; for they are worthy.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with sire.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver these plagues: and they repented not, to give him glory.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness, and they gnawed their tongues for pain,</p>
               <p n="11">11 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the Kings of the East might be prepared.</p>

               <p n="17">17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of heaven from the throne, saying, It is done.</p>
               <p n="18">18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings: and there was a great earthquake, such as were not since men were upon the earth, so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty an earthquake and so great.</p>
               <p n="19">19 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And every island sled away, and the mountains were not found.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God, because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeded great.</p>

This Vial therefore is <hi>immediately</hi> poured on the Earth, several of the other <hi>reflexively</hi> or consequentially. But the Angels are bid all of them to pour the Vials on the Earth some way or other, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>A noisome grievous sore.</hi> This is an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> plague, as the Earth on which it is inflicted, <hi>Aegypt,</hi> spiritually so called, that holds the Mystical <hi>Israelites</hi> the Apostolical Christians in bondage. This plague therefore signifies the fury and envy, wherewith the minds of the Pontifician Party were extremely enraged and exulcerated (driven by evil Spirits, from the Lord, as in the case of <hi>Saul</hi>) against the Risen Witnesses. Which devilish distemper did so dementate them, that they made themselves still more execrable and odious by their impotent and unsuccessfull attempts against them that God had thus exalted above their reach. This therefore is the plain and easie sense of the effusion of the first Vial, and answers to [The Nations were angry] <hi>chap.</hi> 11.18.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>Sea</hi> in the Prophetick style signifies the gathering together of people into one Polity or Kingdom; And here in this <hi>Aegyptian</hi> plague such Dominions must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood as were <hi>Papal.</hi> And the Sea turned into bloud, and the fishes all dead in it, signifies the deadness and hopeles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Pontifician affairs upon the <hi>full settlement</hi> of the Reformation in such Principalities and Kingdoms. The Rising of the Witnesses and partial fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> is like
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:49984:161"/>the Victory of the <hi>Heros</hi> on the white Horse under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Vial, but the <hi>settlement</hi> of the Reformation prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the effect of the second Vial is like the Descent of the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> under the second Thunder.

As <hi>Sea</hi> signified above Politically, so <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Fountains</hi> of waters or Springs, must, that are the Heads of Rivers, and both come from the Sea and return thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>viz.</hi> the water of them. A <hi>Sea</hi> therefore here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Kingdom or Polity, the Rivers must be <hi>Emissary</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the said Kingdom, whether Armies or other Agents with those that head them and govern them, who may be deemed the <hi>Spring-Heads</hi> of them, they taking their direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and motions from them, and depending on them as Rivers do on their Springs. And this being an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> plague again, the turning these Rivers into bloud is the putting to Death the Emissaries of the Mystical <hi>Aegypt</hi> for their <hi>treasonable</hi> Attempts against Kings or Princes, and the settled Religion and Government of the place.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>Sun</hi> may have here either a <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>Mystical</hi> sense. <hi>Mystically</hi> understood, it may be the Word of God, which is a Lamp unto our feet, and a Light unto our paths, as the great Lamp of the Universe is naturally understood to be. Wherefore clear Explications of the Word of God, the Prophetical parts especially, whereby the detestable and damnable condition of those that adhere to <hi>Babylon</hi> or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist is discovered, is the Effusion of the fourth Vial in this first sense, which vexes, scorches and enrages the Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians very sorely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. They are so vext that they blaspheme the Name of God, and rather vilifie the Scriptures and the Spirit that wrote them, than repent them of their sins, and give glory to God by acknowledging the Truth. And this may go for the <hi>Mystical</hi> sense of the Effusion of the Vial on the Sun. But, Sun, <hi>Politically</hi> taken, may be understood of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Secular Power within the Papal Jurisdiction. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any <hi>German</hi> Emperour, or any Potentate as consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable as the <hi>German</hi> Emperour should be so illuminated with the true knowledge of the Gospel, as cordially to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the cause thereof, the general Reformation that any such Potentate would introduce into his Kingdom or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, will scorch, and burn, and vex the Vassals of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast at the very heart, and so will prove the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Vial on the <hi>Sun</hi> in the most proper <hi>Political</hi> sense.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. In a <hi>Mystical</hi> sense correspondent to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Seat or Throne here of the Beast, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast, may be the same that <hi>Cathedra,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>infallible</hi> Chair of that <hi>Pseudoprophet.</hi> To the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of whose frauds the Vial poured out on the Sun, <hi>Mystically</hi> understood, may prepare the way, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under this fifth Vial be generally convinced of the false pretence of the Papal Hierarchies <hi>Infallibility.</hi> The false light of which vain pretence being once removed, they must needs find themselves much in the dark, their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion being such as neither <hi>Scripture, Reason, Common sense,</hi> nor any thing else that has any Authority with it can afford
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:49984:162"/>any light to, so that his Kingdom is full of darkness; and they gnaw their tongues for pain, because this cheat of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility being discovered by the clear demonstration of the Apostasie of the Church, out of the Prophecies, they are quite left in the dark, hopeless and helpless, and know not now what hank to have over the people, who before were made to believe any thing which made for the Church-mens power and gain, upon the Pretence of the Infallibility of their Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. The Event of so great manifestations of Truth was so vexatious to them, that they reproached the Authour of it, the Spirit of God and Holy Scriptures, nor repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they of their deeds. So hardened was the heart of this <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the King of this Spiritual <hi>Aegypt,</hi> nor would he let the people of God go, to serve him according to his own Commands and Precepts. And this may be the <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> meaning of this fifth Vial. But <hi>Politically</hi> understood, the Seat of this two-horned Beast is the same with the Seat of the Whore, who is seated on the seven-hilled <hi>Rome.</hi> And in this sense it bodes ill to that City, as if it would be taken again under this Vial, as it has been often; or at least, as if from the effects of the former Vial, <hi>Politically</hi> understood, there would be a great deadness of Trade to that greatest Merchant of the great men of the Earth, and so great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequentedness, obscurity and darkness would seize his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal seat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. The <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horsemen are the <hi>Turks,</hi> as we have noted in the sixth Trumpet. This Vial therefore sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies such a mutation of affairs in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire, as will make for the joining of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and it may be some other Eastern people, and their Princes or Persons of note, with the Church of Christ; as being either converted, or in a near preparation to Conversion to his Gospel, as may appear from <hi>chap.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. For the marriage of the Lamb's wife there immediately precedes the battel of the Rider of the white Horse, which undoubtedly is the same Vision in effect with the seventh Vial. Besides the Ark of the Covenant, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.19. shews that the <hi>Jews</hi> are
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:49984:163"/>concerned in the sixth Vial; and the Harvest, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 16. that they are then to be converted to the pure Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Christ, and this to the dis-interest assuredly of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast. Thus mutually do those places illustrate one another. And hitherto reach the six first Vials; which, according to our interpretation of them, either directly or reflexively are all poured on the Earth, <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Clay or the two-horned Beast, according to command, <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>The Scene of the seventh Vial now begins, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Conflict and Victory of the <hi>true Apostolick</hi> Church of Christ, (which are one part in this Battel) over the <hi>Antichristian</hi> part the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>false Prophet,</hi> which are the other part, and over the <hi>Infidel</hi> Party which profess not Christ; and this is the third part under the <hi>Dragon.</hi> Which <hi>Tripartition</hi> is worth the noting for the better understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the matters of the seventh Vial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. These Frogs are the Emissaries, Orators, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiators or Solicitors of the affairs of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and of the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>false Prophet,</hi> the two Parties opposite to the <hi>Apostolical</hi> or <hi>Evangelical</hi> Party. And they have the shape of Frogs for their earthliness and slimy uncleanness, to betoken the wisedom they act from, that it is earthly, sensual and devilish.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. <hi>The Spirits of Devils,</hi> &amp;c. These Frogs said to be the Spirits of Devils, are yet to be interpreted of Men under these Spirits or evil Angels Conduct, according to the genius or style of the Apocalypse. And Frogs, in whose shape these wonder-working Spirits are, signifie En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters and Juglers (according to the <hi>Onirocriticks</hi>) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigious Deceivers of the people by false Miracles, feigned Visions, and the like; which haply may be more peculiar to the <hi>Antichristian</hi> Party, the Beast and false Prophet. But the Frog out of the <hi>Dragon</hi>'s mouth, his Miracles may be, besides those of <hi>unlawfull Magick,</hi> prestigious demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to prove the frivolousness of all <hi>Revealed</hi> Religion at least, the better to harden the hearts of the Kings of the Earth against the pure and Apostolick Christians. <hi>To ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them to the battel,</hi> &amp;c. For as that wisedom which is
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:49984:163"/>from above is pure and peaceable, so this earthly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish wisedom delights in confusion and bloud. <hi>Of God Almighty.</hi> Under whose conduct are the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Party or the pure <hi>Apostolical</hi> Christians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. This defeat of false and ineffectual Religions, will be a surprizing Providence to all those that Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally shroud themselves under them, instead of being cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the everlasting Righteousness of the Gospel of Christ, those that cover with a covering, but not of God's Spirit, that they may add sin to sin. But at this time God will pluck off the covering from all Nations, and the Vail of Hypocrisie from off the people, <hi>Esay</hi> 25.7. which is an intimation that this Battel is not so much carnal as spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. By the over-ruling Providence of God they were brought into this place <hi>Armageddon,</hi> which in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew signifies the destruction of their Armies; but there is nothing yet done toward their discomfiture, for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Vial is not yet poured out. And therefore by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of Iconisms (see Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his Notes, and the Answer to <hi>S.

                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>It is done.</hi> This is a firm Decree, signified by the voice out of the Temple from him that sits on the Throne, and a full assurance by his Spirit universally in the hearts of his servants the Evangelical Party, that their Ministry shall succeed, and that there will be an utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Antichrist, and a consummate enlargement of the Kingdom of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 18. There was such a strange Mutation of affairs in the World, as was never known or recorded in any History of former times: Of such mighty efficacy was the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the pure Gospel in the power of the Spirit by the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49984:164"/>Speaking-party of the Army of Christ against the forces of the <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Antichrist.</hi> For this is the meaning of those Voices, and Thunders, and Lightenings, that it was the promulgation (by those <hi>Boanergeses</hi>) of the Law of the Son of God, which is like unto fire, as is related in <hi>Esdras, Esdr.</hi> chap. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 19. <hi>And the great City was divided into three parts, viz.</hi> As there were three parts in the great Camp; The <hi>Antichristian</hi> Party; the purely <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Infidel</hi> Party, and the pure <hi>Evangelical</hi> Party: But this Tripartition is named immediately after this great Earthquake, as if it were the effect of it, for the more handsome embellishing the outward <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Prophecy. <hi>And the Cities of the Nations fell,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Heathenish</hi> or <hi>Infidel</hi> Party were <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-struck</hi> by these <hi>Boanergeses,</hi> and converted to the faith of the Gospel of Christ in the simplicity and purity thereof. <hi>And great Babylon,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Antichristian</hi> Hierarchy with her Adherents, the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as she is called in the following Chapter, are here met withall to the purpose, and forced to drink of the cup of the fierceness of God's wrath, to be arraigned, judged and punished according to the heinousness of her crimes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 20. Their Temples and other consecrated places were taken from them, and they were deprived of their Dignities, or of the assistence of the great ones of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 21. <hi>Ʋpon men a great Hail,</hi> &amp;c. namely, upon <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> or the Antichristian Party. So that all her goodly Trees were spoiled and stript of their both leaves and fruit, their boughs broke down, and their stocks beaten bare even to the inmost Bark. Which being a <hi>different</hi> success of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, upon these, this Hail-storm is mentioned <hi>apart</hi> by it self at the end of all. <hi>And men blasphemed God,</hi> &amp;c. The hearts of this <hi>Antichristian</hi> Party were still hardened, even in this last <hi>Aegyptian</hi> plague inflicted on them, and proper therefore to them. And their rage and impatience under their calamity made them speak evil of the ways of God, which yet are altogether Righteousness and Truth. The
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:49984:164"/>Cities of the Nations fell by <hi>Thunder,</hi> but <hi>Babylon</hi> the same with <hi>Aegypt</hi> is destroyed by an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Plague, <hi>Hail.</hi> Which plainly again signifies to us the difference of those two parties, the one <hi>Infidel,</hi> the other <hi>Antichristian.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>ARG. <hi>A more full description of the</hi> Object <hi>of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Effusion of the Vials, (by one of the Vial-Angels)</hi> viz. <hi>of the</hi> Whore <hi>or</hi> two-horned <hi>Beast. A woman arrayed in Purple and Scarlet, with a golden Cup in her hand sitting on a Beast full of Names of</hi> Blasphemy, <hi>having seven Heads and ten Horns. The Title of the Woman, Mystery,</hi> Babylon <hi>the great Mother of Harlots,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Name of the Beast, [That was, is not, and yet is]. The Interpretation of the seven Heads and ten Horns by the Vial-Angel. That five of the Heads were gone in S.</hi> John<hi>'s time. And the sixth the Pagan</hi> Caesars <hi>then in being. That the seventh was the Head (after the Christian</hi> Caesars) <hi>under which the Beast that was, is not, and yet is, again full of Names of Blasphemy, bears the Whore the joint-will of the ten Horns being so for a time. Who yet after, hate her and burn her with fire. That this Whore is</hi> Roman, <hi>indicated both from the seven Hills, and in that no Polity seated on seven Hills ruled over the Earth in S.</hi> John<hi>'s time but the</hi> Roman.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AND there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto me, Come hither, I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore, that sitteth upon many waters:</p>
               <p n="2">2 With whom the Kings of the earth have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication, and the inhabiters of the earth
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:49984:165"/>have been made drunk with the wine of her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads, and ten horns.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And the woman was arayed in purple and scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations, and filthiness of her fornication.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND ABOMINA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS OF THE EARTH.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And I saw the woman drunken with the bloud of the saints, and with the bloud of the Martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondred with great admiration.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</p>
               <p n="8">8 The beast that thou sawest, was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder (whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And here is the mind which hath wisedom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:49984:165"/>
               <p n="10">10 And there are seven Kings; five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten Kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as Kings one hour with the beast.</p>
               <p n="13">13 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.</p>
               <p n="14">14 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that are with him, are called, and chosen, and faithfull.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, and nations, and tongues.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</p>
               <p n="17">17 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, untill the words of God shall be fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="18">18 And the woman which thou sawest, is that great city, which reigneth over the Kings of the earth.</p>

                  <head>The NOTES.</head>
                  <p>IN the foregoing Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 19. there was a short glance at the Arraignment, Accusation and Condemnation of the Whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But her destruction being the main scope of all the Vials, this argument is more fully prosecuted in this and the following Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>The judgment of the great Whore,</hi> &amp;c. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment, Accusation and Condemnation of the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Idolatrous Hierarchy of <hi>Rome,</hi> seated amongst many people, whose Jurisdiction spreads far and wide, and who pretends to be the Church universal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. With whom the ten Kings (<hi>v.</hi> 12.) have joined in Idolatrous worship, and the Inhabiters of the Earth been so inflamed, so intoxicated and dementated with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome heat of Idolatrous zeal, that it has made them quarrel with all Opposers or Despisers of their fair <hi>Diana,</hi> and so sottish, secure and heedless, that they have lain exposed to all the deceits and injuries this cunning <hi>Circe</hi> could put upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>A scarlet-coloured Beast.</hi> Whose colour denotes Tyrannical Cruelty as well as Imperial Majesty. By this is understood the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. <hi>Full of Names of Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy,</hi> i. e. full of Titles or Kinds of Idolatry. Full of Gods, so <hi>Grotius</hi> interprets it, understanding it of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Empire; but Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> would render it, Full of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or Souls of departed Saints religiously worshipped to the reproach of themselves and their Maker, understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it of the Pagano-christian Empire. The seven Heads and ten Horns the Angel interprets, <hi>v.</hi> 9.12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>Was arayed in Purple,</hi> &amp;c. This idolatrous Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, the Patriarchs or Popes especially, and Cardinals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have this imperial colour and Richness, very gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously apparelled upon occasions in their rich Copes and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:49984:166"/>costly Miters, to say nothing of the furniture of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars. <hi>A golden Cup,</hi> &amp;c. An enchanted Cup or Philtre, an intoxicating Love-potion, to inflame the Empire again with an Whorish desire after Idols. And the very Metal of the Cup is <hi>Magick</hi> enough to intoxicate the brains of their Clergy, with the fumes of Ambition and Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, who are not enriched with the Golden gifts of their Church, but so far as they assist and abet the Idolatry thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>Was a name written.</hi> In allusion to some impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Harlots, who had their Names written on their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads. <hi>Mystery, Babylon the Great,</hi> &amp;c. The first word is a Key to the rest, intimating that <hi>Babylon</hi> is here to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> chap. 11.8. spiritually, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Christian Polity or Hierarchy, so degenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unchristian Tyranny and Idolatry, that it is Mystically called <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in the above-said Chapter, and here <hi>Babylon</hi> the great. <hi>Babylon</hi> as holding the Children of God in such an hard Captivity, and propagating the worship of <hi>Baalim,</hi> Demons or false Gods, <hi>viz.</hi> what is analogous thereto. <hi>Great,</hi> as pretending to be the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or Universal, and indeed having a large Jurisdiction in the Christian World. <hi>Mother of Harlots,</hi> in reproach to her affectation of being called <hi>Holy Mother</hi> the Church, while she is so unholy, as to be the Authour of the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Earth, that is, of Idols or Image worship, which are called <hi>Abominations</hi> in Hebrew. This Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> therefore is the same with the two-horned Beast, with the Horns of a Lamb, as pretending to be a <hi>Christian</hi> Hierarchy, but speaking as a <hi>Dragon, i. e.</hi> decreeing Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries and bloudy Persecutions. As <hi>here,</hi> one part of the charge against this Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is Idolatry. And her bloudy Persecutions follow in the next verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. To be drunk with the bloud of the Saints, shews her excessive and unsatiable Cruelty in persecuting them, not onely burning them with fire and faggot, but destroying them with repeated Massacres, insomuch that she is found to exceed the bloudiness and cruelty of the Pagans against
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:49984:167"/>the primitive Christians under the red Dragon. <hi>I wondred with great admiration,</hi> that God should permit so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and wickedness and so great Prosperity to Consort to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But that <hi>John</hi> might the better understand the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of God's ways, and Providence over his Church, the Angel unfolds the Riddle to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>And ten Horns,</hi> namely, On his <hi>seventh</hi> Head, as appears from the eleventh and twelfth verses of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>The Beast which thou sawest,</hi> his Name is [that was and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless Pit, and go into perdition] and scarce any longer a Name is it than that written on the Woman's forehead. And the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that it is his Name is omitted by a Prophetical Ellipsis. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his Notes on the place. But the occasion of this Name is taken from the time when the Empire had become Christian, and had ceased to be a Beast, that is, to be idolatrous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For then it was true of it, that <hi>it was,</hi> viz. a Beast under the six first Paganizing Heads, but now under the pure Christian <hi>Caesars,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth King, though not the seventh idolatrous Head, he <hi>is not,</hi> for the Empire ceaseth to be a Beast then as not idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, but it was true then, that the Empire would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Beast again ascending out of the bottomless Pit, or the Sea, the latter denoting multitudes of People, of which the Beast would consist, the other the Original of this horrid Apostasie into Idolatry again, as coming from the Pit of Hell it self, and the deceits of the Devil, which is the state of the Empire under the eighth King, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth head of the Beast. But to mitigate St. <hi>John's</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment, there is at last added in this Name. [And go into perdition] which implies, that the Apostolical state of the Empire shall not endure always, but in due time be utterly abolished, and so the Beast cease to be for ever. These several conditions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire as to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are thus Skilfully comprized in this Name of the Beast. <hi>And they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>chap.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 3. All are seduced to follow this Beast, unless the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:49984:167"/>elect of God such as are afterwards termed, the called, chosen and faithfull. <hi>That was, is not, and yet is.</hi> Whose name is so, and most properly so called, under the seventh Head, being the very same with the <hi>Image</hi> of the Beast, <hi>chap.</hi> 13, 14. For the Paganochristian Empire was not properly the <hi>same Pagan</hi> Empire, but rather the <hi>Image</hi> thereof, and the state thereof is fitly expressed in this present Name. The Beast [that was] as being idolatrous as before, [is not] as not being that <hi>Old Pagan</hi> idolatrous Empire [and yet is] as being so <hi>Pagan-like</hi> idolatrous. Which name necessarily imports, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in that succession of time, wherein it had apostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed from the pure Christian worship into Idolatry, and that therefore the Woman that rides this Beast can be no Pagan Polity, but the <hi>Paganochristian</hi> Hierarchy. So that the Name again, as I said before, is contrived to set off the different states of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire as to <hi>Religion.</hi> Which is the main Scope of this Vision, as is farther ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest from the <hi>Whore's</hi> riding the Beast, as well as the Beasts being said to be full of Names of <hi>Blasphemy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. <hi>Here is the mind,</hi> &amp;c. Here lyes the meaning of a great <hi>Arcanum</hi> or secret. For the Greek word <hi>Sophia</hi> seems so to insinuate. For wisedom is according to her name, and is not manifest to the vulgar. <hi>Ecclesiastic.</hi> chap. 6.2. <hi>Seven mountains,</hi> &amp;c. Which haply has a glance at <hi>Constantinople</hi> as well as at <hi>Rome,</hi> both these Cities having seven mountains, and the Greek clergy having corrupted the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church, as well as the Latine clergy the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern.</hi> And the horns of the two-horned Beast, we did above interpret of these two Patriarchates, <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>And there are seven Kings,</hi> viz. signified by the <hi>seven Heads</hi> of the Beast, and therefore <hi>Idolatrous</hi> sorts of Sovereignties. Six <hi>Pagan,</hi> and the seventh <hi>Paganochristian,</hi> otherwise there are <hi>eight</hi> Kings if you take the pure Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Kings in, or <hi>eight</hi> Heads of the <hi>Empire,</hi> though not of the <hi>Beast,</hi> the Empire under the pure Christian King ceasing to be a Beast. Wherefore as by the <hi>Name</hi> of the Beast, so by
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:49984:168"/>the <hi>Enumeration</hi> of the <hi>Heads</hi> of the Beast or Empire, the state of the Empire is set out as to Religion. Which is the main Scope of the Vision, as any one that is not grosly stupid or willfully blind, cannot but easily discern. <hi>Five are fallen,</hi> viz. Kings, Consuls, Consular Tribunes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemviri, Dictatours. These Sovereign <hi>Pagan</hi> Magistrates had passed away in St. <hi>John's</hi> time. <hi>And one is,</hi> viz. the <hi>Pagan Caesars,</hi> these were in being in his time. <hi>And the other is not yet come.</hi> The other King of a quite different nature. For the Enumeration now is of <hi>Kings,</hi> in the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest sense. Wherefore the other quite different King, as the Greek word [allos] implies, is the <hi>pure Christian Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars,</hi> who were not in St. <hi>John's</hi> time. <hi>Continue a short space.</hi> The succession of the pure Christian Emperours will last but a while, the Apostasie not long after being to come in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>And the Beast that was, and is not.</hi> Which above was called the Beast that was, and is not, and yet is, the Head suppose of this Beast, whether <hi>Caesarean</hi> before all the ten Horns had got Kingdoms, or <hi>Hieratical</hi> when the Pope had perkt up above the Emperours or <hi>Caesars;</hi> or <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raticopolitical,</hi> which is most likely, the Whore which is the <hi>Hieratical</hi> power, riding this Beast and guiding and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Head and Horns thereof, as they came up from the very beginning of the Apostasie; this complex <hi>Paganochri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Head, made up of <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> and <hi>secular</hi> Sovereign power, the Sacerdotal being Predominant in what this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion mainly aims at, <hi>viz.</hi> Matters of Religion, as riding the Beast and guiding the Head and Horns, I say, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex Sovereignty <hi>is the eighth King.</hi> But though it be the eighth King, yet it is said, <hi>And is of the seven,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Paganochristian,</hi> and consequently <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the seven Kings, first mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the <hi>seven Blasphemous</hi> or idolatrous Heads of the Beast. It is to wit, the seventh of the seven. So that though there be <hi>eight Kings,</hi> yet there are but <hi>just seven Heads</hi> of the Beast, the Empire ceasing to be a Beast, under the seventh King, the pure Christian <hi>Caesars. And
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:49984:168"/>goeth into Perdition.</hi> In part, at the rising of the Witnesses in the seventh <hi>Semitime.</hi> But at last his idolatrous Power and Tyranny will be quite abolished under the seventh Vial, as is also supposed in several passages in the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation over <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the following Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>Which have received no Kingdom as yet,</hi> &amp;c. that is to say, in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, and sutably hereunto there is no mention of Crowns on the ten Horns, though it be the same Beast with that, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. whose ten Horns are Crowned. But what follows supplies the omission of the Crowns on the Horns, in that they are said to receive Power as Kings, <hi>one hour</hi> with the <hi>Beast. i. e.</hi> As the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was healing into the Image of old Paganism, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Beast again, these Kings or Commanders of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations that invaded the Empire, were catching at and seizing on Kingdoms, some sooner some later, till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 456 they were all sped. Which shews plainly to what time the Beast relates, that bears the Whore. And as the <hi>Paganochristian Caesars first,</hi> so <hi>they</hi> with <hi>him</hi> after became the secular, or Civil part of the <hi>Hieraticopolitical</hi> Head of the Beast, which is the seventh or last Head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. These ten Kings shall be of one Paganochristian Religion, whereby the Empire had again become a Beast, and be ready by force of Arms if need be, or by what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Power or Authority they have, to maintain this Beast, in its <hi>Beastly,</hi> that is, in its <hi>Idolatrous</hi> condition, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan-like Superstitions.</p>

These ten Kings, the Horns of the ten horned Beast, shall War with the Lamb, with the Saints and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, but shall be foiled in the Conclusion: In part of the partial fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and rising of the Witnesses, and utterly defeated in the battel of the Rider on the white Horse, who is there followed by those on white Horses, that are called and chosen, and faithfull, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be sure to stick to him, that has the Right and Title of being King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and has a just claim to all the Dominions of the Earth.</p>

But then it follows. But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his Dominion, in part, within the seventh <hi>Semitime,</hi> but by pouring out of the Vials consume it and destroy it, till there be an end of it.

The sense therefore in brief is this. The woman which thou sawest riding on the Beast, whose name is, [That was, is not, and yet is] is that great City that now ruleth over the Kings of the Earth, namely <hi>Rome;</hi> whose Inhabitants (and Polity there, or Sovereign power) though flowing suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively, are accounted one and the same City, because included within the same reputed Walls and Buildings, as that is reputed one and the same River that flows betwixt the same Banks, though the same water do not continue for a day together: Therefore the ruling Power or Hierarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Polity of seven-hilled <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> (as the two hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Beasts name is <hi>Latinos</hi> in the other Vision, <hi>chap.</hi> 13.) is this Woman that rides the Beast, that was, is not, and
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:49984:169"/>yet is, and most Principally concerned in this Vision. Which contains as it were, the Arraignment of her <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> described from her Quality and Dignity, being Queen or Empress, as it were of the <hi>whole</hi> Empire, as appears by the Beast she rides on; and from her gorgeous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and from her Palace or chief place of Residence seven-hilled <hi>Rome.</hi> But the <hi>Crime</hi> or <hi>Charge</hi> against her is, the corrupting the whole Empire with Idolatry and murthering the Saints of God, and Martyrs of Jesus. Her condemnation or punishment she is doomed to, is very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously and pompously set out in the Chapter following.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>ARG. <hi>Both the partial and final fall of</hi> Babylon <hi>predicted by a mighty Angel. And her ruinous state described toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the cause of her ruine. A voice from Heaven there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore warning men to come out of her before she be overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they with her in this ruine. Redoubled vengeance threatned her according to the excess of her Cruelty, Luxury and Pride. The bewailing of the Kings of the Earth over her, who committed fornication with her. The wofull lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Merchants of the Earth over her, because no man buyeth her Merchandize any more. The most lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble howling of the Ship-masters, at her so sudden desolation. And the joy of the Holy Apostles and Prophets. The utter destruction of</hi> Babylon <hi>prefigured by a Milstone cast into the Sea. With a Repetition of the Reason of this her utter ruine,</hi> viz. <hi>Her Worldly greatness and great Worldliness, her Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures and Sorceries, and the Bloud of the Prophets and Saints, and of all that were slain upon the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>AND after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightned with his glory.</p>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:49984:170"/>
               <p n="2">2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hatefull bird.</p>
               <p n="3">3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the Kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of the earth are waxed rich through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of her delicacies.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues:</p>
               <p n="5">5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembred her iniquities.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto her double, according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double.</p>
               <p n="7">7 How much she hath glorified her self, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a Queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burnt with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And the Kings of the earth, who have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fornication, and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,</p>

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49984:170"/>saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty city: for in one hour is thy judgment come.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her, for no man buyeth her merchandise any more:</p>

               <p n="16">16 And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was cloathed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls:</p>
               <p n="17">17 For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every ship-master, and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in ships, and sailers, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,</p>
               <p n="18">18 And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city?</p>

               <p n="19">19 And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea, by reason of her costliness: for in one hour is she made desolate.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. IN the foregoing Chapter was the <hi>Arraignment</hi> of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in this is the declaration of her Punishment. [<hi>Another Angel from Heaven having great power,</hi> &amp;c. This great and glorious Angel intimates the Greatness and Illustriousness, for Zeal also and Piety, of those Personages of high place, that will concern themselves in the pulling down <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>With a strong voice,</hi> &amp;c. He declareth the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against the great Whore with a strong and strenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous voice, in token of the assuredness and certainty of the execution thereof. <hi>Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen.</hi> Which words either signifie (as <hi>chap.</hi> 14.8.) the thing newly done, and then there will plainly be an <hi>Hysterology</hi> in that warning voice, <hi>v.</hi> 4. Or else they may signifie the <hi>imminent</hi> mischief to <hi>Babylon,</hi> so nearly imminent and <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> as if it were done, and therefore her fate is phrased in the Time past or preter perfect tense. And then the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice, <hi>v.</hi> 4. may come betwixt <hi>this</hi> Prediction and <hi>actual</hi> fall of that great City both <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>final;</hi> nor is to be restrained to the first Reformation begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> but to reach to her utter ruine under the seventh Vial, as is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by that description of her ruinous condition, she having become an Habitation of Devils, an Hold of foul Spirits, and a Cage of unclean and hatefull Birds, as the utter desolation of the literal <hi>Babylon</hi> is described in <hi>Esay,</hi> chap. 13.21. But by these Devils, foul Spirits and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Birds, are understood men, such as are mentioned, <hi>Apoc.</hi> chap. 22.15. Such dolefull creatures will haunt the Ruines of desolate <hi>Babylon.</hi> See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> on the place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. For all Nations have drunk of her poisonous Philtre or Love Cup, and she has corrupted the ten Kings of the Empire with the Abominations of her idolatry; And the Ecclesiastick Merchants, called Merchants of the <hi>Earth,</hi> to denote their Earthly-mindedness, and in reproach to their
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:49984:172"/>false pretended <hi>Spirituality,</hi> are grown rash from the Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riancy of her wealth, and the Spur to get it, their indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Luxury.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>Another voice from Heaven,</hi> Presently succeeding the former, that declared the <hi>imminent</hi> or sudden down-fall of <hi>Babylon, v</hi> 2. <hi>Come out of her my People.</hi> Which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a Commission, nay a Command from heaven to the first Reformers, and all others after to forsake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church of <hi>Rome, That ye be not partakers of her sins,</hi> &amp;c. by being at her Masses and other Idolatrous worship, and so receive of her plagues, whether in this World, or in the World to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>For her sins have reached unto heaven,</hi> &amp;c. And called for vengeance there in the ears of God, who will repay her in part at the rising of the Witnesses, but pay her home under the seventh Vial, when her power shall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abolished as it follows,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. Spare her not, but punish her severely for all her Abominations and Wickednesses. This is a predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what will come to pass under the seventh Vial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. By how much she has magnified her self, and lived Pompously and Luxuriously by so much fuller fill her Cup of vexation and grief. <hi>I sit as a Queen,</hi> &amp;c. Thus she might say in the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> interval before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and boast her self an Empress, and the Bride of the Lamb, the Spouse of Christ, the onely Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and declare all Dissenters from her Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and that she shall see no sorrow. Thus I say might she boast in the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> interval. And if by the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits</hi> of the reformed Churches, she ever recover into that plight again, yet the great Doom will certainly be executed upon her as it follows in the next verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. Therefore unexpectedly, and contrary to her boastfull presages shall this <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy be <hi>Politically</hi> killed, devested of all Power and Authority, whence will be mourning and famine, scarcity and poverty to requite their Luxury before. And in the highest degree shall that be fulfilled which is written, <hi>chap.</hi> 17.6. They shall make
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:49984:172"/>her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire. For strong is he that judgeth her, and there is neither Wisedom strength nor counsel against the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. And the Kings of the Earth that have been of the same idolatrous Profession with her, and have lived Luxuriously with her, this Religion being accommodated to the <hi>Gusto</hi> of great men, it is no wonder that some of the Kings or Princes of the Earth bewail her burning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>For in one hour is thy Judgment come.</hi> But though her judgment be come in one hour, yet the execution of it may take up a considerable time. And this description belongs as well to the time of the <hi>Partial</hi> fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and rising of the Witnesses as to the latter Vials, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the last of all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. The Merchants of the Earth, as I noted above, are Ecclesiastick or spiritual Persons, which in reproach to their Worldliness in their pretended holy and spiritual Functions, are here called the Merchants of the <hi>Earth.</hi> And the Merchandize which no man buyes any more, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the <hi>usual Traffick</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, where all is supposed to pass or to be disposed of for money or earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Interest, which now ceaseth, as she her self ceaseth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. No man buyeth her Merchandize of Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, pretious stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the rich attire of those higher parts of the Whore, as you may see in the foregoing Chapter, fit for Popes, Cardinals, and other great Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> body and their Officers. No Thyine wood for the Roof of Temples or carved Idols that are incensed, no Images or other Utensils of Ivory, pretions Wood, Brass, Iron or Marble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. No traffick any longer in Aromatick Odours, Oiles or Ointments for sacred Unctions. No man will partake any longer of her <hi>Panis benedictus,</hi> nor taste of her Idol-wafer made of the finest flower, nor sip of the wine of her Chalice, though she should offer it to the lips of the Laity. For their idolatrous Mass shall cease, and their be sprinkling of Sheep and other cattel by the Friars of St.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:49984:173"/>
                     <hi>Anthony,</hi> and other profits issuing from them shall cease also, and the redemption of Souls out of Purgatory for money. And lastly, the Merchandize of Chariots, Horses and Slaves, that is of such Dignities in their Church, as whose Equipage is to go with their Coach and Horses, and Lacquies to run by them, this amongst the rest will fail in the ruine and desolation of <hi>Babylon.</hi> See. Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his Notes on the place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. Those great and opime preferments and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which thy ambitious and worldly mind so long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly hankered after, those fat and fair Objects that make Mens mouths run a-water so, in this full <hi>Babylonish</hi> Market, where every thing is to be had for money and nothing without it, all these goodly things are vanished never to appear again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. <hi>The Merchants of these things,</hi> Whether Buyers or Sellers. <hi>Stand a far off,</hi> &amp;c. being solicitous for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor able to help her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. <hi>That great City.</hi> That great Hierarchical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>Cloathed in fine Linen, and Purple and Scarlet,</hi> &amp;c. the very habit of the Whore above described, (<hi>chap.</hi> 17.) and not a City of stone and brick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>For in one hour,</hi> &amp;c. The sense is, such as in verse 10. <hi>And every Ship-master,</hi> &amp;c. that is, every <hi>Nauclerus,</hi> or Rector of a Parish, the Church whereof is his ship. It seems therefore to give a glance at the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish</hi> Churches, abused to gainfull Idolatries and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions. Where they sell the use, the sight or possession of several consecrated things, exchange Souls out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory for money, and turn the very word of God into an adulterated piece of ware or Merchandize, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> on the place, and in his Notes.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>V</hi> 18. Like that of the Mariners Lamentation over <hi>Tyrus,</hi> that great City for Merchandizing (which I know not, that <hi>Rome</hi> was ever so famous for?) What City is like <hi>Tyrus! Ezech.</hi> 27.32.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 19. <hi>That great City.</hi> That great Sacerdotal Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein were made rich all the Ship-masters in the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:49984:173"/>Sea, (in such a Sense as is hinted above) out of that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Dignities, Preferments and Offices, wherewith she was inabled to enrich these Merchants, some in one degree some in another, but now surprizedly, and unexspectedly is she desolate. These three last verses are taken out of <hi>Ezechiel</hi>'s Lamentation over <hi>Tyre,</hi> that City so <hi>Notorious</hi> for Merchandizes in the <hi>literal</hi> Sense, and <hi>Rome</hi> not being <hi>so,</hi> it naturally implies, that we must understand it of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi> Merchandizes, as hath been above declared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 20. Rejoyce ye heavenly minded over these Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of the Earth, and ye that are the Teachers of the pure Apostolick doctrine, be ye glad that the Lord hath avenged the bloud of your Predecessours upon her, the bloud of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses,</hi> and the rest of the holy Martyrs of Jesus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 21. The sense is, That at last there will be an utter ruine and abolition of this idolatrous City or Polity, namely the pouring forth of the seventh Vial. And the mighty Angel signifies the mighty Agents under him, that shall effect it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 22, 23. All this may be nothing else but a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>Hylasmus</hi> setting out one single thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, silence and vast solitude of this idolatrous Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, by the absence of such gross and sensible Objects, as occur in a City inhabited, as the noise of Musicians, the hammering and knocking of Artificers; the grinding of Mills, the light of Candles in the Night, and the singing and dancing at Weddings and the like; Or else in a <hi>Mystical</hi> sense by a <hi>Diorism,</hi> The <hi>Musick</hi> may be, that at their Idolatrous worship, The <hi>Artificers,</hi> the Hammerers out of subtile devices in Theology and Church policy for the Interest of this Hierarchy, The <hi>sound</hi> of the <hi>Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones</hi> their fraudulent profit. The <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Candles,</hi> that of their consecrated Candles, or Candles burning upon Altars, or before Images; and lastly, the voice of the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> and the Bride, the proselyting Countries and Provinces, and considerable Personages to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, of which the Pope forsooth, pretends to be the Bridegroom.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:49984:174"/>So that every such proselyting, is as it were a new Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding betwixt the Pope and the proselyted. But the voice of this Bridegroom and Bride, shall now be heard there no more. Hitherto the destruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> is described, the particular <hi>Reasons thereof</hi> follow, which are three. Two in the remaining part of this 23. verse; The first, The <hi>Riot</hi> and <hi>Loraliness</hi> of these Mystical Merchants, who are the great men of the Earth, and greatly Worldly, Ambitious, Covetous and sensual, which is the very Essence of an earthly mind. The other, the debauching the World with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> carried on with a pretence of power plainly <hi>Magical</hi> in changing the Elements in Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and charming of Images into wonderfull powers and vertues, with other Magical feats and Necromantick stories of Apparitions of Saints and all in order to introduce or support Idolatry, whence Idolatry is here indigitated by Sorcery or <hi>Witchcraft.</hi> And what is that Cup in the hand of the Whore, but a <hi>Philtrum</hi> or Love-potion made with <hi>Magical</hi> charmes, and of horrid Ingredients. And what is the being deceived by these <hi>Sorceries,</hi> but the being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into <hi>Idolatries</hi> by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 24. Here's the third Reason of the destruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, their <hi>bloudy Cruelty.</hi> And there is laid to their charge, not onely the bloud of <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> that is, of faithfull Preachers, and Expounders of the Gospel, and other pious men that stuck to the truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, but the bloud of all that have been slain upon the Earth. So great Incendiaries have the Pope and his Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries been, and disturbers of the Peace of Christendom. But that it should be the <hi>secular</hi> Merchants of <hi>Rome,</hi> that are these <hi>Sorcerers</hi> or <hi>Magicians,</hi> and <hi>Murtherers</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the shedders of <hi>all</hi> the bloud spilt in Christendom, is such a sensless conceit, that nothing can be more wooden or plumbous.</p>

A great Accession, to the Kingdom of Christ by the calling of the</hi> Jews, <hi>set out by the Marriage of the Lamb with his Spouse made ready for him, which is glanced at also in the</hi> sixth Vial <hi>and the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the</hi> Harvest. John <hi>overjoy'd at the News, would worship the Angel, but is forbidden by him. A new Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the battel of the great Day of God Almighty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the seventh Vial. The mighty</hi> Heros <hi>on the white Horse with a sharp sword coming out of his mouth, whose Name is the</hi> Word of God. <hi>His vesture dipt in bloud, and his treading of the Wine-press alluding to the Wine-press trod without the City, bloud reaching to the Horse-bridles. The Issue of this War, the</hi> Beast <hi>and</hi> false Prophet <hi>taken</hi> alive, <hi>not slain, by the sword, and therefore cast into a Lake of fire, wherein the Bestial and Pseudoprophetical Power is dissolved. But the</hi> Infidel <hi>Party</hi> slain <hi>with the</hi> sword <hi>coming out of the</hi> Heros<hi>'s mouth the living Word of God; And so are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the infinite joy of all good men and Angels. And hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto reach the</hi> seven <hi>Vials comprized in the</hi> first Thunder <hi>of the</hi> seventh Trumpet.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AND after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power unto the Lord our God:</p>
               <p n="2">2 For true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the bloud of his servants at her hand.</p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:49984:175"/>
               <p n="3">3 And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And the four and twenty Elders, and the four beasts fell down, and worshipped God that sate on the Throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thundrings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made her self ready.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And to her was granted, that she should be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen is the righteousness of saints.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage-supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And I fell at his feet to worship him: and he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and he that sate upon him was called faithfull and true, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.</p>
               <p n="12">12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:49984:175"/>his head were many crowns; and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself.</p>
               <p n="13">13 And he was cloathed with a vesture dipt in bloud: and his name is called, The Word of God.</p>
               <p n="14">14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, cloathed in fine linen, white and clean.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And he hath on his vesture, and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>
               <p n="17">17 And I saw an angel standing in the Sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the sowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather your selves together unto the supper of the great God;</p>
               <p n="18">18 That ye may eat the flesh of Kings, and the flesh of Captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.</p>
               <p n="19">19 And I saw the beast, and the Kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to make war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him that sate on the horse, and against his army.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:49984:176"/>These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sate upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. THis Doxology in Heaven is but a Resemblance of what in those times will be done by the true Church on Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>Which did corrupt the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. Debauching the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire with Idolatry. Which therefore cannot be understood of <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan. For the parts of the Empire then, were Idolatrous of themselves. <hi>The bloud of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> &amp;c. The causes of the destruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy was their <hi>Idolatry</hi> and their <hi>Cruelty</hi> against the Professours of pure Christianity, as was observed at the end of the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>Her smoak rose up for ever and ever.</hi> In such a sense as is said of the destruction of <hi>Idumaea, Isa.</hi> 34.10. It shall not be quenched night nor day, the smoak thereof shall go up for ever, from generation to generation it shall lye waste, none shall pass through it for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. The whole truly Catholick and Apostolick Church praised and glorified God upon the utter destruction of the Whore, the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, in opposition to the <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of her Paramours or Antichristian Party. And as the <hi>Kings</hi> of the Earth, <hi>chap.</hi> 18.9. are set in the first place bewailing her, so the <hi>Elders</hi> here are placed first in this Doxology for her destruction. And this reaches to the end of the Vials. In the rest of the Chapter there is a Regress to the sixth and seventh Vial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>A voice came out of the Throne;</hi> namely, the voice of Christ. This answers to the Son of man, who puts in
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:49984:176"/>his sickle, and reaps the <hi>Harvest,</hi> chap. 14.14. which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately precedes the treading of the <hi>Wine-press,</hi> which synchronizeth with the following Vision of the Rider of the white Horse, as that with the seventh Vial. <hi>Praise our God,</hi> &amp;c. This is the voice of Christ as he is Man. See <hi>John</hi> 20.17. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. The many Waters and Thundrings are Symbols of Multitudes of people praising God for the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of his enlarged Kingdom, the waters of <hi>Euphrates</hi> being dried up to make way for the Kings of the East to join in one Communion with the pure Church of Christ. This therefore synchronizeth with the sixth Vial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. That is to say, The people of the <hi>Jews</hi> are now in a readiness to join with the Holy Catholick and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church of Christ, and that is a ground of the greatest joy imaginable. For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the World, what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. It was granted to her to be cloathed with the everlasting Righteousness of the Gospel of Christ, which consists not in meats and drinks, but in a true rectitude of mind, peace of conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost; that being thus cloathed, she may not be found at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Vial amongst the number of the naked then, to their great shame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. <hi>Blessed are they,</hi> &amp;c. O thrice happy they that shall see those times and partake of them, and celebrate the Espousals of the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> to Christ their Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom and true Messias, as he will then be acknowledged. <hi>These are the true sayings,</hi> &amp;c. As unlikely as it may seem to men that these dry bones shall live again, (as the <hi>Jews</hi> are represented in that Vision of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>) yet the thing will certainly come to pass.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>And worshipped him.</hi> This he did, being so full of joy and transport at so transcending good news touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Jews</hi> his Countreymen. For whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> also had so great a zeal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>See thou do it not,</hi> &amp;c. For it should seem the Mien of his face conjoined with the posture
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:49984:177"/>of his body, betray'd such a pitch of veneration as was more than civil, and not due nor warrantable from one fellow creature to another. Besides, that this Angel and <hi>John</hi> (as also others of his quality) were fellow-inspired Souls, both endued with the Spirit of Prophecy, which is the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Jesus. For no man can say Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. They cannot be true and faithfull witnesses of Jesus out of love and loyalty to him, but they must be inspired by his Spirit. Such a Spirit of Prophecy was in the two Witnesses, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. whose faith was so strong, that they could suffer the utmost for the Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>And I saw Heaven opened.</hi> Now follows the Vision that synchronizeth with the treading the <hi>Wine-press,</hi> and with the <hi>seventh Vial,</hi> which will give admirable light to both. <hi>A white Horse.</hi> An Horse with his Rider doth signifie Rule and Command, and the colour, <hi>White,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous success. <hi>And he that sate upon him,</hi> &amp;c. The Rider is the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> incarnate, once crucisied on the Cross to draw all men unto him. In the seventh Vial there was mention of the battel of the great day of God Almighty, but no mention there of any <hi>Armies,</hi> or of any <hi>Captain</hi> of the Forces. Lo! here is the <hi>Commander</hi> of the Army, Christ himself, who in righteousness doth judge and make war.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>His eyes were as a flame of fire.</hi> Symbols of a piercing discernment and inflamed anger against sin and impenitent sinners, as it was said even now, who in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness doth judge and make war. <hi>Many Crowns.</hi> For the Kings of the East by this time had submitted to him, besides what might be done under the fourth Vial. <hi>That no man knew but himself.</hi> This in brief signifies the incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness and imperscrutableness of the Divinity of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. He alone that is it being able to comprize it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. <hi>A vesture dipt in bloud.</hi> This relates chiefly to his <hi>Passion,</hi> and partly to the Vision of the Treading the <hi>Wine-press,</hi> where bloud is said to ascend up to the Horse-bridles, whence his garments would be dipt in bloud. And is a sign that these two Visions, this and that of the <hi>Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:49984:177"/>tend to the same thing. And it is no wonder his garment <hi>alone</hi> is said to be dipt in bloud, and none of his followers, it being intended as a Symbol of his <hi>bloudy Passion,</hi> and he is said, <hi>Esay</hi> 63. to tread the <hi>Winc-press</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. All his Victories are to be imputed to his alone <hi>Passion</hi> and Mission of the <hi>Spirit. Called the word of God, viz.</hi> Incarnate and once crucified. But in this Triumph of the living Word, the written Word also will have a share. Which the false Prophet or Idolatrous Hierarchy of <hi>Rome</hi> had not onely silenced, but most barbarously had troden down those <hi>innate</hi> Principles of <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> that the Eternal Word had implanted in the Souls of men, and by terrour and cruel force did what she could to smother, stifle and extinguish them. But here the Scene is changed, and the pure Word of God like a Valiant <hi>Heros</hi> triumphs over the corrupt, superstitious, idolatrous and contradictious Doctrines and Institutes of a company of deceitfull and deceivable men, which in this Vision is called the <hi>false Prophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. <hi>And the Armies,</hi> &amp;c. Here be the <hi>Evangelical Armies</hi> (as before we noted the Commander) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the battel of the great day of God Almighty under the seventh Vial. <hi>In fine linen, white and clean.</hi> A strange kind of Armature, if it were to be understood literally of such a battel as Souldiers ordinarily fight in the field. White <hi>armour, bright</hi> and <hi>shining</hi> had been more proper for a <hi>literal</hi> War of righteous Warriours. And that this <hi>white linen</hi> has no bloud on it, though the Vesture of their Commander has, and that <hi>before</hi> the battel, is a farther confirmation that his Vesture dipt in bloud denotes his <hi>Passion,</hi> and that the War is <hi>Mystical.</hi> As what follows does still more evidently prove to any one that has his eyes open to truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. <hi>And out of his mouth goeth a sharp Sword,</hi> &amp;c. This again shews, that this is no <hi>Carnal</hi> warfare, when, as before this great <hi>Heros</hi> was called the <hi>word of God,</hi> so here a <hi>sharp Sword,</hi> is said to come out of his <hi>mouth,</hi> the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon wherewith he smites the Nations, in allusion to that
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:49984:178"/>of <hi>Esay,</hi> chap. 11.4. And he shall smite the Earth with the Rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. Which <hi>Forerius</hi> and <hi>Alapide</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, (I may add also <hi>Calvin</hi>) of the victory of the word of God over wicked men, slaying them <hi>as such,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting them to a quite contrary state. And thus is Christ said by the Spirit of his mouth, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. to consume the man of sin, that is, by the power of the word as <hi>Calvin</hi> expresly interprets it, and compares it with that of <hi>Esay.</hi> Read also <hi>Esdras.</hi> Book 2. chap. 13. v. 4.10.38. <hi>And shall rule them,</hi> &amp;c. This alludes to <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.9. where out of the Original it is <hi>Conteres eos,</hi> Thou shalt <hi>bruise them,</hi> intimating that <hi>Contrition</hi> of heart which the living word will effect seasonably and powerfully attacking the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Christ's Kingdom. <hi>He treadeth the Wine-press,</hi> &amp;c. He treadeth the Wine-press and that <hi>alone,</hi> as it is said in <hi>Esay,</hi> as his Vesture <hi>alone</hi> is here said to be dipt in bloud, and amongst this whole company on white Horses, he <hi>alone</hi> is said to ride weaponed, <hi>viz.</hi> with a Sword com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his mouth. Is this likely then to be a <hi>literal</hi> or <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Warfare, or is not this rather the Mystery, that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in this battel is wholly to be attributed to the <hi>bloudy Passion,</hi> and to the promised <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ in his Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Armies, who shall preach the word, (which is the Sword of the Spirit) with stupendious power and success, Christ alive in these this Evangelists, setting out most pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically and effectually the weight and merit of his endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Passion</hi> on the Cross, and now fulfilling in the most am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple manner, what he predicted of his suffering there, That he should draw all men unto him? And this is that which squeezes so the Grapes in the <hi>Wine-press,</hi> that bloud rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the Horse-bridles for 1600. furlongs together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. This sheweth the Royal descent of Christ, even according to the flesh, as if he had laid claim to this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, by descent from <hi>David</hi> the King, as it is said chap. 22. I am the root and Off-spring of <hi>David,</hi> and the <hi>bright</hi> morning Star, the root of <hi>David</hi> as to his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the Off-spring of <hi>David</hi> as to his Humanity, to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:49984:178"/>whom the utmost parts of the Earth are promised, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>An Angel standing in the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. In the most bright and Glorious light of the Gospel (for by Angel is understood men under his Governance) or Holy word of Prophecy, as Sun is interpreted in the fourth Vial, by the illumination whereof they were able to play the auspicious Heralds, and proclaim the victory on the Evangelical par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties side, before the battel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 18. <hi>And the flesh of Horses, and them that sit on them,</hi> &amp;c. That is, The flesh of Horsemen, by an <hi>Hendiadis,</hi> a figure that divides into two, which should be spoke as one. <hi>And the flesh of all men,</hi> &amp;c. These are certainly those that are slain by the Sword of him that sate upon the white Horse.

All the holy Angels were feasted and filled with
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:49984:179"/>the Joy of their Conversion. How the three Parties in these three Visions exquisitely answer one another, namely that of the Wine-press, the seventh Vial, and this present Vision, <hi>viz.</hi> The Grape-treaders, the Boanergesses, and the Army of the Heros on the white Horse, as the <hi>Evangelical</hi> party.

                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>An Angel from Heaven,</hi> denotes a Commission from God. <hi>The bottomless Pit,</hi> the Prison of Evil Spirits, the Dungeon of the <hi>Rephaim.</hi> And the <hi>Key</hi> thereof signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the having Power and Authority to doe things there,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:49984:181"/>the very Kingdom of the Devil being subject to the power of God. And the <hi>great Chain</hi> is the power of <hi>Legislation,</hi> or of making Laws, which are bonds and iron chains to tye up the wicked from doing mischief. Wherefore the Antichristian and Infidel Power or Polity being broken or abolished, by this Angel from Heaven are understood those persons empowered from God to make Laws for the more sure support of the recovered Kingdom of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>And he laid hold on,</hi> &amp;c. By these express severe Laws touching the indispensable duties of a Christian, not insignificant trifles and superstitions, is that old Serpent the Devil or Satan, that is, the wicked ones of what deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination soever, to be laid hold on. This is the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the <hi>new Polity</hi> after the abolishing of the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Tyranny.</hi> Which constitution of things being settled and dispatched under the second Thunder, then follows the binding of him a thousand years, which is the time of the third Thunder, and of the blessed <hi>Millennium,</hi> properly so called; which reaches to the end of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Interval.</p>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore during the happy <hi>Millennium</hi> of the reign of Christ, he is as close a Prisoner as can be imagined or expressed. Whence it is plain this <hi>Millennium</hi> is not yet come. The parable is of the Devil, but so as to be understood of his Children here on earth, to be kept under with Iron or Adamantine chains of rigid inviolable Laws, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to doe any thing that is really profane, wicked or Antichristian, nor to tempt or seduce others to doe it: There will be no publick Permission or Connivence for such things. This is the <hi>Political</hi> sense which is the main, and most assured sense of the Devil's being bound up for a thousand years; touching his <hi>physical</hi> or <hi>literal</hi> chaining up in the Dungeon of the <hi>Rephaim,</hi> see the <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Remarker</hi> on the place, and <hi>Paralipomena Prophetica,</hi> chap. 19. <hi>Be loosed a little season,</hi> namely, in the <hi>Laodicean</hi> interval, the Evangelical party growing more cool and remiss, and the Church degenerating in many from the state of <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi>

This Vision looks back (as is usual in the Apocalypse) and commenceth with the second Thunder: Then were there Judges sitting upon Thrones, and gave judgement touching the Christian <hi>Confessours,</hi> that worshipped not the Beast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Martyrs.</hi> Of these two distinct sorts it is said in common, that they <hi>lived,</hi> as being true of both, and <hi>reigned</hi> with Christ, not <hi>a</hi> thousand years, but as the Original has it, <hi>the</hi> thousand years, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> the Martyrs in <hi>Heaven,</hi> (though not in a stinted sense) where Christ is <hi>Personally</hi> present, the other with their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours on <hi>Earth,</hi> where Christ is present by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> These in Bodies <hi>Terrestrial,</hi> those in <hi>Celestial</hi> and glorified.

But they that have obtained their glorified body, as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs do in the first Resurrection, they are sped already, and are safe from this fate. And being holy and divine Souls, cloathed in glorified bodies, shall serve God in his heavenly Temple, and shall reign with Christ in the Kingdom of his Father, not <hi>the</hi> thousand years of the <hi>Millennium</hi> onely, but as the Original has it <hi>a</hi> thousand years <hi>Symbolically</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, which being the <hi>Cube</hi> of <hi>Ten.</hi> which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all number, signifies a steady permanent reign even to all Eternity.</p>

Expositours universally agree, that <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is here meant, and <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Israel</hi> suits well thereto. And what beloved City
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:49984:182"/>can this be, but that new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> whose name is writ on the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.12. (and is said to come down out of Heaven from God) though now in the <hi>Laodicean</hi> interval. For she is that <hi>everlasting Pillar</hi> in the Temple of God, which endures to the end of all, though under a new denomination of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> And as she is said to come <hi>out of Heaven</hi> from God, so it is plain she is still <hi>on Earth,</hi> being besieged by <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog:</hi> and is called here onely the beloved <hi>City</hi> not <hi>Jerusalem</hi> as the papal Hierarchy, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.13. is onely called the <hi>City</hi> not <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> But here is an attempt it seems of taking this <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and bringing again the righteous under the Power and Tyranny of the wicked, <hi>viz.</hi> at the latter end of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> interval under the fifth Thunder. But before they could effect their wicked enterprize, the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment overtakes them, as plainly appears from the residue of this and the whole following verse.</p>

Which shews plainly that the day of Judgment puts an end to the siege of the beloved City, and that they hold out till then.</p>

This is a description of the general Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which is a good while after the <hi>Millennium</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. The Books opened, allude to Rolls and Records in Courts of Judicature amongst men. And that auspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Title of the <hi>Book of Life,</hi> signifies that they whose
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:49984:183"/>names are found there, should be sentenced as worthy of eternal Life, and escape the second Death. And that the dead are Judged according to what is written in these Books, intimates that in this general Assizes, none shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for what he is not guilty of, but be judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works, recorded and proved out of these Books.</p>

And the divine <hi>Nemesis</hi> proportioned Punishments, or rewards to every one according to their doings. Hitherto are the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of this general Assizes, and the passing of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on those that are called to the Bar, which takes up the sixth thunder.

A more large and glorious descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the New</hi> Jerusalem <hi>setting out the blessed State and</hi> Polity <hi>of the Church of Christ in his</hi> Millennial <hi>Reign. The Names of the twelve Tribes of</hi> Israel <hi>written on her twelve Gates. The twelve Foundations of the Wall, with the Names of the twelve Apostles inscribed on them. The City measured with a</hi> golden <hi>Reed by an</hi> Angel, <hi>and the form thereof found Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bical. The City of pure Gold transparent as glass. The twelve foundations of the Wall of twelve pretious stones, all tending to the safety of the City, and conserving the</hi> Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian <hi>State thereof. The twelve Gates of Pearl. What the Temple of the City. No Sun nor Moon there. To whom the Gates of the City stand open, and who are shut out.</hi>

               <p>AND I saw a new heaven, and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.</p>

               <p n="2">2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and there shall be no more death, neither sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And he that sate upon the throne, said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithfull.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And he said unto me, It is done: I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is a-thirst, of the fountain of the water of life, freely.</p>
               <p n="7">7 He that overcometh, shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.</p>

               <p n="9">9 And there came unto me one of the seven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the Bride, the Lambs wife.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great City, the holy Hierusalem, descending out of heaven from God,</p>

               <p n="11">11 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most pretious, even like a Jasper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, clear as crystal:</p>
               <p n="12">12 And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve Angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.</p>

               <p n="17">17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the Angel.</p>
               <p n="18">18 And the building of the wall of it was of Jasper, and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.</p>
               <p n="19">19 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of pretious stones. The first foundation was Jasper, the second Saphir, the third a Chalcedony, the fourth an Emerald,</p>

A <hi>New Heaven and a new Earth,</hi> as if it were a new Natural Heaven and Earth upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration (immediately mentioned before) of the former. But this is but the artificial embellishing of the outward <hi>Cortex</hi> of this Book of Prophecies in this place, by a <hi>Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matosynechia,</hi> which is as palpable and assured an <hi>Apocalyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Figure as any is observed, by Rhetoricians in other Authours. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his Notes on the place. And that Earth here is joined with Heaven, it implies that a state not merely in Heaven, but on Earth is described. For there is no Earth in Heaven. <hi>For the first Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. For
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:49984:185"/>the former <hi>Polity,</hi> in the Prophetick style, signified by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, that is, the Tyrannical and Idolatrous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>false Prophet,</hi> or great City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> was now abolished, as appears by <hi>chap.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>And there was no more Sea.</hi> No unquiet multitudes of the wicked like the raging Waves of the Sea foaming out their own shame, <hi>Jude</hi> 13. Tumults, war and bloudshed was under that Polity that is cast into the Lake of fire, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.20. which was the Reign of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> But now the Reign of <hi>Christ</hi> is at hand, the true <hi>Molchisedeck</hi> King of <hi>Salem</hi> or <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> King of Righteousness, and Prince of Peace. This Vision therefore goes back to the second Thunder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>The holy City New Jerusalem,</hi> &amp;c. The truly Holy City, not pretended Holy Church, and the <hi>new Jerusalem,</hi> not that <hi>old</hi> Prophet killing <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which opposition betwixt these two <hi>Jerusalems,</hi> shews they are both <hi>on Earth,</hi> and that the <hi>new</hi> succeeds instead of the <hi>old.</hi> And the <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> above that S. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.16. is the pure Apostolick Church on Earth, which she may, as <hi>Astrea</hi> is said to have done, seem to have left, during the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering Reign of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but is here said to come down from God again out of Heaven. Which plainly shews it is a renewed Polity here <hi>on Earth,</hi> settled after the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> by a Council truly Holy and truly Oecumenical, by men of pure and upright spirits, full of that wisedom which is from <hi>above,</hi> whenas the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> or <hi>old Jerusalem</hi> was from that wisedom which is from <hi>beneath,</hi> and is earthly, sensual and devilish. <hi>Prepared as a Bride,</hi> &amp;c. Which again shews it is a description of a state <hi>on Earth,</hi> not in Heaven. For not <hi>preparation,</hi> but perfection and possession belongs to that state. But she is prepared as a <hi>Bride,</hi> by way of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis,</hi> not as a <hi>Whore</hi> to commit fornication with the Kings of the Earth as <hi>Babylon</hi> did. This Constitution of things is settled under the second Thunder, after which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follows the <hi>Millennial</hi> Reign of Christ in this <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> described in the following Verses.</p>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:49984:186"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 3. This verse seems to be a Paraphrase on that short name of <hi>Ezechiel</hi>'s City, <hi>chap.</hi> 48.35. <hi>Jehovah shammah,</hi> The Lord is there. But that description of the City by <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel,</hi> denotes a state of the Church on <hi>Earth,</hi> therefore this does also that alludes to it. Besides that it is said here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly. Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men. If he <hi>Tabernacle</hi> with Men it must be on earth, as the term [Men] implies, Earth being their usual abode. But if they were conceived in Heaven, they should be rather said to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi> with <hi>God</hi> in his proper abode. But he is with them here on Earth by his Spirit, and by his Power to guide them into all truth, and keep them from all evil. As it follows,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>And God shall wipe away all tears from their Eyes,</hi> This reign of Christ in the <hi>Millennium,</hi> will be with that Equity, goodness and sweetness that no good heart shall need to be oppressed with grief, nor to express his grief with tears. For there will be no more <hi>Death,</hi> no bloudy Massacres of the faithfull Witnesses of Christ, or burning them at the stake, as was done under the Tyranny of the great Whore. No <hi>sorrow</hi> for the loss of Friends, thus barbarously murthered. No <hi>clamours</hi> against gross In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice and Cruelty, or <hi>crying out</hi> for the Tortures inflicted on poor innocent men for a good Conscience toward God. Nor any more <hi>pain</hi> by noisome and wearisome Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or what other hardships for their Testimony to the truth. For the former Polity is passed away, the bloudy Whore or false Prophet, with the Beast are now in the lake of fire that burns with brimstone. And <hi>Babylon</hi> the Great like a Milstone sunk into the bottom of the Sea, never to rise again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>All things new,</hi> A new Heaven and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. And when he is bid so earnestly to set it down for a truth, that there will be this <hi>Jerusalem</hi> state so Holy, happy, and secure from all evil, it is a plain Indication, that such a state <hi>on Earth</hi> is asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for who doubts but that the state in Heaven is such.</p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:49984:186"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. <hi>It is done.</hi> The thing is as sure as if it were done already. This is a farther confirmation to him of the truth of this state, and that it will be <hi>on Earth.</hi> For <hi>John</hi> could not doubt, but that all would go well in Heaven. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega,</hi> &amp;c. I comprehend all within the compass of my Providence and Power. Therefore never distrust, but that what I have told will come to pass, and farther things also. For this seems to reach into the <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicean</hi> interval, and what follows in the residue of this verse and the two next, to appertain to the last Judgment of all. The eternal reward of the good, and Punishment of the wicked. Christ here promisseth to him, that doth seriously desire and endeavour after everlasting Life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the methods of the Gospel, to give it him free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he need not buy it with large sums of money, as was usually in that Merchandizing City of <hi>Babylon.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 7. He that overcometh the Flesh, the World and the Devil, God will be his God and he his Son, and if Sons then Heirs, Heirs of God, and joynt Heirs with Christ in the glorious Kingdom of his Father, and this certainly comprizeth all that heart can wish. And this is the promise to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> to him that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes, that he shall sit down with Christ in his Throne, even as he overcame and was set down in his Fathers throne. Where throne plainly implies a Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. As before was set down the reward of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so here the Punishment of the wicked, especially such as <hi>Babylon</hi> abounded withall. They have their part in the lake burning with fire and brimstone, which is the second Death. Which therefore undoubtedly is the Conflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under the last Thunder. Which plainly shews, that from the second verse to the ninth, is a brief description of the affairs of the Church, from the second Thunder to the end of the World. Now as after a brief mention of the ruine of <hi>Babylon, chap.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 19. there is a large des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of her, and her destruction, <hi>chap.</hi> 17. and 18. so here after a brief intimation of the state of the <hi>New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> there is a more full and glorious description there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:49984:187"/>from the ninth verse following of this Chapter, to the sixth of the next.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9. The Vial-Angel mentioned here, was in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood the same that before shewed him the Judgment of the great Whore, as if he shou'd insinuate, that the Vial-Angels were so busie in ruining the Polity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the <hi>Old</hi> Prophet-killing <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> because they had in their eye the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> that should succeed her, which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implies that the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is a state here <hi>on Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. The mountain great and high, denotes the height, power and dignity, the pure Apostolick Church is then arrived to, which is called the <hi>Great</hi> City, as being the Church Catholick spread far and wide, and the <hi>Holy</hi> Jerusalem, as being the truly Holy Catholick and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Church, not a Synagogue of Idolaters, Sorcerers and Murtherers, and to descend out of <hi>Heaven</hi> from God, as whose Constitution and Institutes are not the <hi>Carnal</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of men, but the <hi>pure</hi> Laws of the <hi>God of Heaven,</hi> and the living Dictates of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>Having the Glory of God.</hi> Not as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees in the <hi>Old Jerusalem,</hi> that sought Glory one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but were strangers to that Glory which is of God, the Glory of true approved wisedom and unspotted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. <hi>Like a Jasper stone clear as Crystal.</hi> The <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary</hi> of this City, which was instead of a <hi>Sun,</hi> is likened to a most pretious stone, the <hi>Jasper</hi> stone clear as Crystal, by which I conceive is understood the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> And the times of the New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> are <hi>Regnum Spiritus,</hi> as the <hi>Cabbalists</hi> call them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>The twelve Tribes of the children of Israel.</hi> The number twelve is sacred in Holy Scripture, for the twelve <hi>Patriarchs</hi> sake, and the twelve <hi>Apostles.</hi> The former are mentioned here, the latter <hi>v.</hi> 14. and both concur in this <hi>New</hi> City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and signifie the time thereof to be when <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> shall accord in one faith, and be one sheepfold, which again denotes this <hi>Jerusalem</hi> state to be <hi>on Earth.</hi> But if it were understood merely of the state of the Church in Heaven, what it can signifie worthy the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:49984:187"/>Spirit of Prophecy is not easie to imagine. The twelve Angels at the twelve Gates, may signifie either the <hi>Guard</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> to keep the City, <hi>Psal.</hi> 127.1. Or else the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours</hi> under these twelve Angels, ready to admit Converts into the Church from all quarters of the world, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the next verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. This plainly alludes to the description of the number, and site of the Gates, <hi>Ezech.</hi> chap. 48.30. Which again shews, that this <hi>Jerusalem</hi> state is to be <hi>on Earth.</hi> And there are three Gates against every quarter, in token that Converts are to be admitted to the Profession of their Faith in the Holy Trinity, at their Baptism as <hi>Grotius</hi> and others have noted. Nor does this season being <hi>Regnum Spiritus,</hi> superannuate this Sacrament, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. And the names of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> are said to be written on the Gates, because a <hi>Jewish</hi> dispensation, that is, the keeping and observing an external rule of Life as well as we can, which is the effect and sum of sincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, gives us admittance into the dispensation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life in the new Birth. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> on the place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. This sheweth the pure Apostolicalness in this constitution of the Church, and insinuates what a safety thereto this Apostolicalness is. For walls are for safety, and these are the very Foundations of the walls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. The Church, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. was measured there by a man, but this new state of things by an <hi>Angel,</hi> that <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> with a Reed, this with a <hi>golden</hi> Reed. Which implies, that this new state of things will as much surpass that state of the Church, though <hi>Symmetral</hi> to the Reed it was then measured with, as Angels do men, and a golden Reed, an ordinary combustible one; as there indeed was within those first four hundred years (which are accounted the <hi>Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral</hi> times of the Church) that which was combustible, and ought to be consumed. But the pure word of God, and Spirit of love abide for ever. But in the mean time this measuring of the Church with a combustible Reed, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. and here with a golden Reed, this <hi>Antithesis</hi> implies the state of them both to be here <hi>on Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:49984:188"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. The squareness of the City is a Symbol of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. The length, breadth, and height being equal, declares it of a <hi>Cubical</hi> form, and consequently not to be a <hi>City</hi> but a <hi>Polity,</hi> and not to signifie Walls and Houses but Men. And that the solid content of the City is said to be twelve thousand furlongs, it denotes the constitution of things <hi>entirely Apostolical,</hi> and that it is more peculiarly described in opposition to the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, the <hi>Perime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the Cube <hi>twelve thousand furlongs</hi> being the circuit of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as the <hi>Perimeter</hi> of the Cube <hi>twenty five thousand furlongs</hi> (which twenty five is the root of the number of the Beast) is according to Mr. <hi>Potter,</hi> the circuit of <hi>Rome;</hi> who has also noted the <hi>Antistechalness,</hi> or Counter-corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence of the twelve Gates, Angels, Tribes, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> to the twenty five Gates, Pastours, Parishes, Cardinals in the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which is again another plain Indication that the state of the New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is a state here <hi>on Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>The measure of a man, that is of the Angel,</hi> viz. in the shape of a man, and whose measuring is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>humano more,</hi> by extracting the square root. Now the root of 144 is Twelve, which shews the height and thickness of the Wall; and being Twelve, it denotes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the pure Apostolicalness of the frame thereof, and the strength of it from the Apostolick Fabrick. And that the <hi>pure Apostolicalness</hi> of this City is so much inculcated, is certainly in <hi>opposition</hi> to the Corruptions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, so contrary to Apostolical doctrine and practice. Which shews plainly that the state of the Church <hi>on Earth</hi> is prefigured by this New <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 18. <hi>Was of Jasper.</hi> So <hi>Jahalom,</hi> the Hebrew word is rendred by the Septuagint, and is the hardest Gem that is, unconquerable by Hammer or Fire; whence the <hi>Greeks</hi> call it <hi>Adamas,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us. Wherefore the Wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing said to be made of this Stone, signifies how firm and inexpugnable it is. And is a Symbol of invincible patience and fortitude, without which the rest of the vertues signifie little in the day of trial. <hi>Pure gold like unto clear glass.</hi>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:49984:188"/>Which therefore resembles the Amber in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vision, that Divine Element of Regeneration. But the golden colour is the tincture of the Spirit of <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> which is signified by <hi>Gold</hi> in this Vision wheresoever it is mentioned, Gold being by far the most noble of all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, most pure and most permanent, as the Apostle saith Charity is, which never fails, whatever becomes of other gifts or graces. And this City is in the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of the Church, whose proper character is <hi>Divine Love.</hi>

But he is here again the first foundation of the Wall, the principal ground of their strength and safety, according to those phrases of the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.16. strengthned with might by his Spirit, and rooted and <hi>groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> in love, <hi>i. e.</hi> having your <hi>foundation</hi> in love. So it is in the Original. Which is this Spirit of Love, the first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Wall of this City. And this <hi>Jasper,</hi> which in Hebrew is <hi>Jahalom,</hi> is said to have the vertue of moving <hi>conjugal</hi> affection, which again sutes well with the New <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalems</hi> being the Spouse of the Lamb. And perfect love casteth out fear, and is stronger than Death. <hi>The second a Saphir.</hi> A stone of the colour of the Heavens, a Symbol of Heavenly-mindedness, and is said to be an Amulet against lust, and therefore a fit means to keep the New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in her <hi>pure Philadelphian</hi> condition, that is to say, in the <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Divine Love,</hi> which is counter-distinct to lust and wantonness, of which some Sects that have pretended too early to this <hi>Philadelphian</hi> state, have been, I fear, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly suspected. <hi>A Chalcedony.</hi> A kind of Carbuncle, a glowing Gem like fire, which signifies holy zeal, and keeps the <hi>Philadelphians</hi> from sinking into the nauseous state of lukewarmness, which is so severely reprehended in the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and which brings <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> on
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:49984:189"/>them at last. <hi>An Emerald.</hi> Smaragdus, the Hebrew word is <hi>Bareketh,</hi> so named from casting out <hi>Lightning</hi> as when it <hi>Thunders;</hi> whence it is also called <hi>Ceraunius.</hi> This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the safety of the City by those <hi>Boanergeses,</hi> Preachers of the Gospel in the Power of the Spirit, such as appeared under the seventh Vial, and battered down the Cities of the Nations; who serve also here for the preserving their own City, better than Canoneers of a City playing from the Walls thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 20. <hi>A Sardonix.</hi> A stone of a threefold colour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath <hi>black,</hi> in the midst <hi>white,</hi> and above <hi>reddish.</hi> This is a Symbol of the due frequenting of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, as the Gates of the City with the Angels, <hi>i. e.</hi> Pastours or Bishops to admit Converts to the Sacrament of Baptism, is a Note of the retaining that Sacrament. The <hi>black</hi> therefore at the bottom is the <hi>Death</hi> of our Lord, the foundation of this solemnity that celebrates his Death till he come; the <hi>White</hi> the Bread, and the <hi>Red</hi> the Wine, the Elements that are made use of in the celebration of his Supper. And this is a good hold on the Church from relapsing into Heathenism again, as some Enthusiasts have seemed too prone to doe. <hi>A Sardius.</hi> In Hebrew called <hi>Odem</hi> from its red bloudy colour; which intimates our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of preferring our faith before our lives, and also of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring those horrid Cruelties and bloudy Butcheries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pagan and Paganochristian Polities, and so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an eternal aversation and watchfulness against such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable Religions. Which therefore is one part of the Wall of safety about the New <hi>Jerusalem. A Chrysolite.</hi> A stone which hath its denomination from <hi>Gold.</hi> Whether the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher's stone be here glanced at, let the Chymists consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But that it strengthens the Intellect, chaceth away folly and faint-heartedness, and encreaseth wisedom and constancy of mind, is the opinion of <hi>Lithologers.</hi> It is also an obvious Symbol of the <hi>firmness</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> whereby these stones of the living City of God are held fast together, which is an egregious ground of safety indeed. <hi>A Beryl.</hi> A stone excellent to make <hi>Collyriums</hi> or Eye-salves of, the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:49984:189"/>want of which is upbraided to the Church of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> Wherefore it is a good prop from the falling into the <hi>Laodicean</hi> state, and for the keeping the Church safe in the <hi>Philadelphian,</hi> being enabled by a due quick-sightedness to foresee a far off how to order their affairs for their security against the Rabble of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog. A Topaze.</hi> It has its name from the Hebrew word <hi>Paz,</hi> which signifies <hi>Aurum solidum,</hi> solid Gold, or Gold well purified, for that makes it the more solid. This is that Gold tried in the fire, which Christ counsels the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Church to buy of him, for want of which she had become so poor and miserable. This <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paze</hi> therefore may well be a stone in the Wall of the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian</hi> Church, to keep her still in that condition, it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying pure love firmly radicated in the Divine Element of Regeneration. <hi>A Chrysoprasus.</hi> A Gem of an <hi>austere</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, as <hi>Grotius</hi> and others have noted, but the <hi>golden</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour being mixt with it, it signifies <hi>Animum subtristem &amp; benignum,</hi> the best temper of mind in the world, and most like to our blessed Saviour's. This is a great Conservative of the Reverence that is due to holy personages, when light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and mirth diminisheth their esteem. And those, whom by this artifice they would win, ordinarily feed onely on the sweet of their Converse, but let the wholsome alone: like fishes that have a trick to nibble away the bait, and avoid the Hook. Such a severe guard therefore over our Converse, contributes also to the guard and safety of the City. <hi>A Jacinth.</hi> A stone of a bright clear Sky-colour, which therefore signifies that inward cheerfulness, calmness and serenity of mind in this state of the Regenerate, which the Apostle calls Righteousness, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost; which they having once tasted, they will be ever unwilling to be deprived of, and therefore never like to relapse from the state of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> or the New <hi>Jerusalem. An Amethyst.</hi> This stone, according to its Name, is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulet against drunkenness, so frequent a vice in the <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Church, to be drunk with wine and strong drink, as it was for the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to be drunk with the bloud of Saints and Martyrs. But the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church keeps
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:49984:190"/>free from this debauchery, whereby she is secured from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Vision, and stumbling in Judgment, and from the Armies of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> which would soon invade the City—<hi>Somno vincque sepultam,</hi> overwhelmed with sleep and wine. So necessary a stone therefore for the safety of the City, is this <hi>Amethyst</hi> to be placed in the Wall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 21. The Gates being Inlets into the City this truly holy Church, they signifie the entrance by Baptism, and are said to be of <hi>Pearl,</hi> the colour of that Gem shewing the mildness and innocent child-like meekness of those that are fit to enter, as our Saviour has declared. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.2. And the Greek name of this Gem, in allusion to the Hebrew words <hi>Mar-garon,</hi> which signifies either <hi>bitter Conflict,</hi> or <hi>bitter Rumination,</hi> that may evidently denote a farther Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in those that be admitted, sincere <hi>Repentance</hi> for what is past, and a <hi>stout Resolution</hi> of resisting all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to sin for the future. The whiteness also of the stone may intimate the washing away the guilt and stain of sin in the Sacrament of Baptism. But now for the street of the City. <hi>Forum Ʋrbis,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> notes, the publick place where they meet and transact affairs, it is said to be <hi>pure gold,</hi> like to <hi>transparent glass,</hi> because they doe all things <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> in pure love and sincerity, as if they were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent one to another, and could see one anothers hearts and thoughts.</p>

But the eternal uncircumscribed Deity is the <hi>Object</hi> of their worship; and the Lamb inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the whole body of Christ, the holy Catholick Church, is the <hi>House</hi> wherein he resides, the same with the City it self, which from his Presence there, is called <hi>Jehovah Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> Ezek. 48.35.

The Kings therefore of those many Kingdoms, that in those days become the Kingdoms of Christ, shall have no other Supreme Head over them but Christ himself, but be as the four and twenty Crowned El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders before the Throne of the Lamb, and have no other Superiour, neither Patriarch nor Monarch but he.

THis River of Water of life from the Throne of God is the faithfull and effectual administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice, and pouring forth holy and wholsome Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and Monitions in the demonstration of the Spirit by them that are in the highest Authority in this City of God. Which authority is understood by the Throne of God, and of the Lamb, who in right of his Father is Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of all, and the immediate Actuatour of his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents. See the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> chap. 5.24. <hi>Let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</hi> And <hi>Ecclestiastic.</hi> 24.25. where wisedom, and understanding, and the doctrine of knowledge are compared to the Rivers of Paradise.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. This Verse is so plain a Transcript out of the Vision of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> chap. 47.12. that here it is manifest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that the description of that City being generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of a State of the Church here <hi>on Earth,</hi> this is so to be understood also. Besides that passage of the Leaves being for the healing of the Nations, confirms the same. For there is no want of Medicines and healing in Heaven. <hi>Was there the tree of life,</hi> that is, Trees of life, else how could they be on this side and that side the River. Which Trees, according to the Prophetick style, signifie great Men, <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> in Church and State, and are called Trees of life in opposition to the state of the wicked, whom <hi>Jude</hi> (v. 12.) calls Trees, whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, <hi>&amp;c. And yielded their fruit every month:</hi> So unces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant are they in the bringing forth the fruits of true Faith, which are good works. Here seems to be an Allusion to <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.3. and 72.7.

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:49984:193"/>Christ's Kingdom, obliging all unto them by their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian goodness and equity, which is the constant fruit which they bear. <hi>For the healing of the Nations,</hi> i. e. The people of those several Nations which are then brought under the Empire of Christ. It is an insinuation of the gentle, but effectual healing <hi>discipline</hi> which will be in this <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Interval.

But here it will not be amiss briefly to declare, that though there be so many and so certain marks to assure us, that by this <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> here described, is signified a State of the Church here <hi>on Earth,</hi> yet I question not, but that the description is such, that it is an intended <hi>Type</hi> of the State of the Church properly Triumphant in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and that as the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church was a Type of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Church at large, so this <hi>excellent</hi> State of the Christian Church on Earth, signified by the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> is a <hi>Type</hi> of the Church Triumphant in <hi>Heaven,</hi> so transcendently there holy, happy and glorious. I say it is an <hi>intended Type</hi> of Heaven, and so fitly is the Close of all the Visions reaching to the last Thunder, when the wicked shall wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the fiery lake, and the godly be translated into that glorious State, the <hi>Archetypal Jerusalem</hi> in Heaven, of which the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> on Earth was but a <hi>Type.</hi> But this is a thing not to be insisted on in these short Notes. See Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> his <hi>Paralipomena Prophetica,</hi> chap. 20. <hi>And the Lord God,</hi> &amp;c. But the Lord God of the holy Prophets has sent his Angel to shew unto his servants, not onely things at such a distance, but the things also nearer at hand, to be done under the first six Seals.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>Seal not the sayings,</hi> &amp;c. As if they concerned onely times a-far off, or many Ages to come. <hi>For the time is at hand,</hi> viz. The time of exercising the faith of the true followers of Christ, and of the salvage cruelty of their Enemies. First, the faith of the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Christians under <hi>Paganism,</hi> and then of the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> and <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelici under a <hi>Paganochristian</hi> Synagogue. The faith of the one, and the foul cruel spirit in the other, would be still more and more manifested to the World. Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence administring occasion for the discovering both in their colours, not forcing the wills of either by his abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Omnipotency; whence it follows in the next Verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>He that is unjust,</hi> &amp;c. Let their unjust Cruelty, and barbarous Persecution, and foulness of life, and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Idolatry go on in the <hi>Pagan,</hi> and afterwards in the <hi>Paganochristian</hi> Polity; till they are ripe for judgment, I will not stop them: And let the righteous encrease more and more in Honesty of Conversation, and Purity in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Zeal against all Idolatry, not refusing the Assisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my spirit and grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>Behold I come quickly,</hi> &amp;c. namely, to judgment, and will abolish the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion, and set up the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian under the sixth Seal, in the reign of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:49984:194"/>judge the Whore the Idolatrous Hierarchy, under the <hi>sixth Trumpet,</hi> and utterly destroy her under the <hi>seventh Vial;</hi> and he that is righteous, growing still more righteous; and he that is holy, still more holy, introduce the glorious State of the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> under the <hi>second Thunder.</hi> These things are within the compass of my Providence and Power, For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega,</hi> &amp;c. I am the first and the last, and my Kingdom shall out-last all Kingdoms, neither shall any Power upon Earth survive my reign in the Holy City <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Whence follow the words of S. <hi>John,</hi> as relating to those times, in the next Verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. Blessed are they that walk uprightly according to the external Word or Law, that they may be baptized at last into the dispensation of the Spirit of life in the New Birth, and thus entring through the Gates, may become true members of this <hi>living</hi> Church of Christ, the <hi>New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and enjoy all the holy and healing Privileges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which have been above described.</p>

Without are brutish, obscene, Atheistical men, and jugling pretenders to Miracles, and <hi>Kainish</hi> persecutours had they but power, and in the mean time gross Idolaters, and either Lovers of lying Legends, or Inventours of them. These unclean Birds are kept out of the New <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but have their dismal Haunts in the Rubbish and Ruines of the demolished <hi>Babylon,</hi> as hath been noted above.</p>

The whole Book of the Apocalypse is, as it were, one Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to them all, as they are concerned in their several suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions. <hi>Root and Off-spring of David.</hi> This may denote his <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Humanity,</hi> and the being the Son of <hi>David</hi> the true <hi>Messias,</hi> his right to the Kingdoms of the Earth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.8. And from the greatness and glory of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he is here called, <hi>the bright Morning Star,</hi> though in the <hi>Sardian</hi> Interval, onely the Morning Star. Whence it seems to glance at the beginning of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:49984:195"/>and respect the <hi>Heros</hi> on the white Horse with <hi>many Crowns</hi> on his Head, which sutes well with the saying of S. <hi>John</hi> in the following Verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come.</hi> The <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> because this is the Commencement of those times that are properly called the <hi>Reign</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> by the <hi>Cabbalists.</hi> And the voice of the <hi>Bride</hi> is added to signifie the Churches earnest desire of a settlement of things into the glorious condition of the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> upon the destruction of the bloud-drunken Idolatrous <hi>Babylon. Let him that heareth, say, Come;</hi> that is, let him pray for the Acceleration of so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a settlement of things. And then our Saviour speaks (for it seems to be a kind of Dialogue from verse 10. to the last.) <hi>And let him that is a-thrist,</hi> &amp;c. He that sincerely hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and thirsts after righteousness, and whosoever has a will and desire, let him come and enjoy the happy Privileges of this <hi>living</hi> City of God freely without money, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaks, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 18, 19. <hi>For I testifie to every man,</hi> &amp;c. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion betwixt these two Verses, and the foregoing Verse, is this: It is a reason to enforce the acceptance of his so earnest invitation to the enjoyment of the described condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that the condition is so certainly destined, and so good and perfect, that if any one presume to adulterate the same by adding any incongruous humane Inventions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, he shall incur the plagues written in this Book, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they concern this life, or the sulphureous lake of fire, which is the second Death. And if he be so faint-hearted, or of so little faith, as to conceit there will never be such an excellent State of the Church on Earth, he shall lose his part in the Holy City and Book of Life, he shall never be able to enter into the blessed <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> State neither here, nor in its Antitype, in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>Surely I come quickly,</hi> viz. for the fulfilling the Visions of the first six Seals, and what synchronizeth with them, to support his Church in their <hi>Smyrnean</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and to defeat their Enemies under the sixth Seal. To which S. <hi>John</hi> answers, <hi>Amen, Even so come Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
                     <pb n="379" facs="tcp:49984:195"/>This was seasonable for him to say in his time, That Christ would come and judge the Dragon; As it was season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the Church in the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> and <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and is now in the <hi>Sardian,</hi> to say, Come Lord Jesus to judge the <hi>Paganochristian</hi> Hierarchy quite to be abolished under the seventh Vial; And in the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Interval, to say, Come Lord Jesus to that General Judgment, when death shall be swallowed up in victory, and all the Saints shall be translated into the incorruptible state of Heavenly bliss and glory. And this whole Book being a general Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitory <hi>Epistle,</hi> as it were, to the Church Universal through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Ages, he sutably concludes with the usual form of Valediction in the Epistles of the Apostles. <hi>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c.
